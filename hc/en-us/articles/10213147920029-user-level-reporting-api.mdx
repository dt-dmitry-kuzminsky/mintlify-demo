User Level Reporting API Metrics and Dimensions

The User Level Revenue Reporting API enables you to access reporting data to measure all revenue generated from individual users. This information can be used to optimize retargeting campaigns and accurately measure user lifetime value.

You can query revenue, impressions, clicks and conversion metrics across the available dimensions. For all supported metrics and dimensions for the User Level Reporting API, click the Metrics and Dimensions tab above.

## Reporting API Workflow

The publisher makes a POST request using the Client ID and Client Secret to receive the Access Token, as described in Step 1.

Once the request is successful and the Access Token is received, an API Request is made to get a custom report as described in Step 2. A successful response will contain a URL leading to a file containing the custom report. More details can be found in Step 3.

## Step 1: Obtaining the Access Token

Digital Turbine's Reporting API uses Access Tokens for authentication purposes. To obtain your Access Token, you must first get your Client ID and Client Secret.

Obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret

1. Sign-In to the Console, [here](https://console.fyber.com/login)

   </Frame>](/hc/article_attachments/10215612162717)

2. On the top-left side of the screen, click your User ID

3. Click User Profile to display the Reporting API Keys

   </Frame>](/hc/article_attachments/10215643951005)

4. If necessary, you can click Revoke to delete the current credentials.\
   You are returned to the API Keys window.

5. Click **Generate New Keys** again, to receive new credentials.

Keep your Client ID and Client Secret safe, as they can be reused in the future. Using your Client ID and Client Secret make a POST request to receive your Access Token.

The base End Point for the entire process is: `https://reporting.fyber.com`

### Authentication Token

```bash
POST /auth/v1/token
```

### Headers

```python
Content-Type    application/json
```

### Sample Request

```ruby
https://reporting.fyber.com/auth/v1/token
```

### Params

```python
format  csv
```

### Body: raw (application/JSON)

```php
{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "3ce66d885XXXXXXXXXXa3b752bb9058",
    "client_secret": "YtMvC7VYTQMQ7w9UCUaFXXXJnwVZnQqqN02XNyt8IIh2h8XFDu
XXXXXXXXSS6XTrFWW4TkebCcMLJkrXSw5IurkearTJIDzUxsbiMXv8hb4T23MwN6eE7DDIthR

qwe8N2GGn_VSFOwQYxa-yap2JuNSGJfl_ZURXXXXXXXXFe1GpHDn8pk7yYwQYIGAg"
}
```

The credentials are sent according to the OAuth 2.0 Protocol

## Sample Authentication Response

When an authentication request is successful, you receive the following response in JSON format:

## Successful Response

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXXXJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NzAwMTY5MDAsImV4cCI6MTU3MDAyMDUwMCwiYXVkIjoic3BlZWRiYWxsIiwic3ViIjoiMjEwMjYzIn0.hDo1waTytSys_oRhFNUPqZPom26bL05rxgtSt3XYHqI",
  "tokenType": "bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

**accessToken:**The token required to continue the process

**tokenType:**Bearer

**expiresIn:**3600 seconds (1 hour)

## Unsuccessful Response

When a request is unsuccessful, you receive the following response:

```json
{
  "error": "internal_server_error"
}
```

## Possible Authentication Errors

Set out in the table are a list of possible errors which resulted in an unsuccessful response.
