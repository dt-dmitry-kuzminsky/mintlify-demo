title: "Setting Up QPS Throttling"
---

Queries per second (QPS) throttling offers DSPs control over their bid stream by setting limits on the number of bid requests they receive from DT Exchange. DSPs may use QPS throttling for the following reasons:

* To ensure queries to the DSP server never exceed the maximum server capacity.
* To slowly ramp up traffic volume during new integration testing.
* To avoid wasting server capacity in countries without high demand.
* To allocate supply volumes according to high-level inventory types (display vs. video).

To configure QPS Throttling for your integration:

1. From the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Bidder Settings→QPS Throttling**.\
   The **QPS Throttling** window appears and lists each of your endpoints.

2) Expand an endpoint, and for each ad format you service on the endpoint, select one of the following throttling methods and enter a bid request limitation: 1,000–250,000 QPS.

| THROTTLING METHOD  | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disable Throttling | Do not limit bid requests for an ad format, and let all bid requests through to the endpoint. For more information, see[DisablingThrottling](#NoThrottle).                        |
| Country Throttling | For the endpoint, limit bid requests originating from specific countries to the indicated QPS. For more information, see[SettingUp CountryThrottling](#CountryThrottle).         |
| Overall Throttling | For the endpoint, limit bid requests to the indicated QPS, no matter where the bid requests originate. For more information, see[SettingUp OverallThrottling](#OverallThrottle). |

3. Click **SAVE**.\
   The QPS Throttling for your integration is configured.

## Setting Up Country Throttling

Country throttling limits bid requests from specific countries.

To limit bid requests from specific countries:

1. For the ad format, you want to limit bid requests, select **Country Throttling,** and expand the **Countries** drop-down list.
2. Select a country from the **SearchforCountry** drop-down list and enter a bid limit: 1,000–250,000 QPS.
3. If you want to add another country for this ad format, click**ADDCOUNTRIES** and repeat Step2.

4. Once you have entered all the countries and associated bid request limits, click**SAVE**.\
   Country throttling is now configured for the selected ad format.

To modify bid request limits for a country:

1. To change a limit for a throttled country, enter the new bid request limit: 1,000–250,000 QPS.
2. To remove throttling for a country, click**Delete** for the throttled country and confirm the deletion.
3. To remove all country throttlings settings, see[DisableThrottling](#NoThrottle).

## Setting Up Overall Throttling

Limit all bid request traffic to an endpoint regardless of request origin.

To set up Overall Throttling:

1. For the ad format that you want to limit bid requests, select **OverallThrottling** and enter a bid request limit: 1,000–250,000 QPS.
2. To change existing limits for an ad format, enter a new bid request limit: 1,000–250,000 QPS.
3. Click**SAVE**.\
   Overall throttling is now configured for the selected ad format.

To modify Overall Throttling settings:

1. To change an overall throttling setting, enter the new bid request limit for the ad format: 1,000–250,000 QPS.
2. To remove overall throttling for an ad format, see[DisableThrottling](#NoThrottle).

## DisablingThrottling

Disabling throttling permanently deletes all bid request limitations for an ad format.

To remove throttling settings for an ad format, select **ThrottlingDisabled**.

#### Important

The DT Console does not request a confirmation when disabling throttling. Once you disable throttling, all bid request limits are deleted, and you cannot restore deleted settings.
