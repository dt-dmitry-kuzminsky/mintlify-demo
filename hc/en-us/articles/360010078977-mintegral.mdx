This article is for publishers who want to use the DT FairBid SDK to mediate placements with Mintegral.

Mintegral currently supports the following [ad types](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010915358-Ad-Types-and-Placement-ID):

* Interstitial
* Rewarded

To integrate Mintegral as a DT mediated network:

* [Step 1: Locate Mintegral parameters](#h_01J539GTZE7DEWJ0CT03G6QMDD).

* [Step 2: Add Mintegral as a DT mediated network](#h_01J539GTZE18GR52MNBPJ0CG0Q):

  * [Add Mintegral as a Waterfall network](#h_01JR1G04Y8EQ448YVJBH66FTCY).\
    This allows for traditional waterfall mediation with Mintegral. Ensure that your app and bidding placements have been added to the Mintegral network.

  * Add Mintegral as a Bidding network:

    * [Add Mintegral as a manually managed Bidding network](#h_01JR1G04Y90043CT09PA745W7W).\
      This allows DT to include Mintegral in bidding mediation. Ensure that your app and bidding placements have been added to the Mintegral network.
    * [Add Mintegral as an automatically managed Bidding network](#h_01JR1G04Y99WMZEF6CJ57VXMH0).\
      This allows DT to include Mintegral in bidding mediation. DT adds your app and bidding placements to the Mintegral network on your behalf.

* [Step 3: Add the Mintegral SDK to your integration](#h_01J539GTZEQTPRGYQQ40ER2Y5B).

* [Step 4: Test your integration](#h_01JD5KSNMT3FTDSB3M5VS3BP1Q).

## Step 1: Locate Mintegral Parameters

Depending on the type of mediation intend use, adding Mintegral as a mediated network requires specific parameters from the Mintegral Dashboard. Before you can locate these parameters, use the following table to ensure that you have completed any app setup tasks in the Mintegral Dashboard.

#### Note

## Step 2: Add Mintegral as a DT Mediated Network

Before you add Mintegral as a DT mediated network, complete the following tasks in the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/):

* Add your App to the DT ecosystem. For more information, see[Adding an App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308-Adding-an-App).
* Ensure that you have a DT Placement for each Mintegral ad type you want to mediate with DT. For more information, see[Setting Up Placements](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468-Setting-Up-Placements "Create a DT placement").

## Adding Mintegral as a Waterfall Network

To add Mintegral for Waterfall mediation:

1. From the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→App Management**, locate the **Network** tab for your app, and click**Addnetwork**.\
   The list of available networks appears.

#### Note

Some networks offer both traditional waterfall and programmatic bidding. Networks that offer programmatic bidding appear as separate tiles labeled specifically for bidding. For waterfall mediation, do not select the *bidder* version of the network.

3. Create a Waterfall network instance for each Mintegral AD unit you want DT to mediate. Use the Mintegral `AD Unit ID` you located in [Step1](#h_01J539GTZE7DEWJ0CT03G6QMDD) as the **Instance ID**.\
   For more information, see[Adding a Waterfall Instance](/hc/en-us/articles/15111147606428-Setting-Up-Instances#h_01JREWSZ35BVDEVSB8XDXFHKZW).

## Adding Mintegral as a Manually Managed Bidding Network

To add Mintegral for manually managed bidding mediation:

1. From the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→App Management**, locate the **Network** tab for your app, and click**Addnetwork**.\
   The list of available networks appears.

#### Note

Networks that support programmatic bidding appear as separate tiles labeled specifically for bidding. To offer your placements for bidding, make sure you select the *bidder* version of the network—in this case,**Mintegral bidder**.

## Step 3: Add the Mintegral SDK to your Integration

To integrate the Mintegral SDK, follow the instructions on the [SupportedNetworks](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010077777-Supported-Networks) page.

#### Note

If you use Android and ProGuard, reference the [Mintegral tips](https://github.com/Mintegral-official/mediation-android/blob/master/mediation/proguard-rules.pro "Mintegral SDK integration instructions") for integrating your ProGuard configuration.

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Use the DT Test Suite to verify that you have set up your app properly for FairBid mediation. The DT Test Suite is available for Android, iOS, and Unity apps. For more information, see [DT Test Suite](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16840582428316-Test-Suite "Using the DT Test Suite").
