title: "Placement A/B Test"
---

Placement A/B Testing is a method that allows you to experiment with different configurations within your Offer Wall placements and determine an effective setting to boost user engagement and revenue.

DT’s Placement A/B Test evaluates multiple ad placements within an app to determine which performs better based on engagement, conversions, and revenue. It runs two or more variations simultaneously, which allows you to test exchange rates, colors, banners, and layouts. You can analyze metrics such as Click-Through Rates (CTR), Offer Conversions, and Unique Users to determine the effective placement and improve ad performance.
