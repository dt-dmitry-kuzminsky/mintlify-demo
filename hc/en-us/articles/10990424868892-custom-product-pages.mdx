title: "Custom Product Pages"
---

CPP enables the utilization of custom product pages in response to clicks initiated on StoreKit-based iOS components, including SKOverlay and StoreKit.\
Additionally, DTX allows the attachment of a designated CPP ID to a bid response, enabling it to be utilized for click handling and redirection.

#### Note

DT Exchange supports CustomProductPages on iOS 15 or later

## Supported Features

* Demand-side platforms (DSPs) utilize iOS's native StoreKit-based components
* App developers create distinct versions of their App Store product page, each with a unique design. These pages can be individually measured for marketing purposes
* Bidding with a specific CPP value per impression, enabling DSPs to specify a particular product page ID

## Configuring in AppStoreConnect

* Ensure that DT supply supports CPP functionality (iOS 15+ compatibility) and utilizes DT Exchange SDK version 8.2.3 or later
* When these conditions are met, a new field labeled "productpage" with a value of 1 (DT oRTB reference) is included under BidRequest.imp.ext.skadn.r
