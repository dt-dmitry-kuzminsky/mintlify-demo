title: "CCPA And CPRA"
---

The California Consumer Privacy Act ([CCPA](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/)) and the California Privacy Rights Act ([CPRA](https://thecpra.org/)) protect the personal information of California residents. It applies to all businesses operating in California. If a California resident uses an app developer's mobile app, CCPA applies to the developer and all relevant partners that process users' personal information.

DT FairBid Ad Mediation supports API integration for the CCPA and CPRA compliance.

#### Note

For more information about which Ad Networks support CCPA compliance, see [Regulatory Compliance for Mediated Networks](/hc/en-us/articles/360013311257).

## SDK APIs

All SDKs include APIs to communicate user consent provided to DT and share the communicated consent to DT's demand partners and mediated ad networks. To comply with CCPA and CPRA requirements, integrate the DT FairBid SDK with your app. DT also recommends notifying your users to update the app to maintain compliance. ****
