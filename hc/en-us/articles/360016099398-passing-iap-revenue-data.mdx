title: "Passing IAP Revenue Data"
---

To evaluate campaign profitability and the quality of a traffic source, advertisers rely on various KPIs, the most common being Return On Ad Spend (ROAS). Advertisers can easily pass DT in-app purchase data for users acquired through marketing activity on the DT Offer Wall , thus allowing DT to calculate ROAS and to display the data across our reporting tools easing campaign decision making and the optimization process.

| IAP Revenue               | Total revenue generated from in-app purchases. DT only processes IAP Revenue data from users attributed to DT by your MMP.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Advertiser Spend          | Advertiser's total cost of acquiring users through marketing activity on DT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) | Advertisers's ROI from marketing activity on DT. This is calculated by dividing IAP Revenue by Advertiser Spend.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MMP                       | Mobile Measurement Platform e.g. AppsFlyer, Adjust, Kochava.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Cohort                    | A group of users that share a common characteristic. DT groups user cohorts by the date they first clicked on an advertiser's offer. When selecting a certain timeframe on our reporting tools the cohorts included in the calculations will be the users who clicked on the offer within that timeframe. |

## How Does DT Collect IAP Revenue Data?

IAP Revenue data is passed by MMPs in the postbacks they send to DT.

All you’re required to do is enable sending IAP Revenue data to DT through your MMP’s dashboard and the data will start to be collected.

## Supported MMPs

* AppsFlyer
* Adjust
* Kochava
* Singular
* Branch

Detailed documentation for each MMP can be found at the end of the article.

## How is IAP Revenue Data Used?

DT aggregates IAP Revenue data and displays the below metrics across our reporting tools:

* IAP Revenue

  Sum of all in-app purchases generated by users who installed the app as a result of an advertiser's marketing activity on DT Offer Wall.

* ROAS

  (IAP Revenue)/(Advertiser Spend).

- D3/D7/D30 ROAS

  * (Total IAP Revenue 3/7/30 days post installation)/(Advertiser Spend)
  * These are three separate metrics that are all available in our reporting tools.

## Understanding the Data in DT's Reporting

Digital Turbine has two reporting views available for advertisers to track and analyze campaign data - Performance and Billing. To understand the difference between each refer to this article [here](https://developer.fyber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015987057-Performance-vs-Billing-Data).

Set out below is an explanation of how to understand the data when viewing it on either Performance or Billing reporting:

| Metric         | Performance                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Billing                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IAP Revenue    | Total IAP Revenue generated by a cohort of users who clicked on an offer within a selected timeframe.                                                                                                             | Total IAP Revenue generated within a certain timeframe.                         |
| ROAS           | Total IAP Revenue generated by a cohort of users divided by total cost to acquire those same users.                                                                                                              | Total IAP Revenue divided by total Advertiser Spend within a certain timeframe. |
| D3/D7/D30 ROAS | Accumulated revenue a cohort of users generated 3/7/30 days after the day of installation, which is referred to as D0, divided by advertiser spend for the chosen timeframe. Partial user data is also included. | Total IAP Revenue divided by total Advertiser Spend within a certain timeframe. |

Metrics on ACP Edge are based on Performance data and should not be used for billing comparison.

### Comparing Digital Turbine's Reporting Data to MMPs

MMPs generally present IAP Revenue based on user cohorts which is similar to DT's Performance data, while the Advertiser Spend used to calculate ROAS is based on Billing data that MMPs collect using DT's Reporting API. This difference may cause discrepancies in ROAS and Advertiser spend.
