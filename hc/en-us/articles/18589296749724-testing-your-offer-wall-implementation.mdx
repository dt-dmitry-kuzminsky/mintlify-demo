title: "Testing Your Offer Wall Implementation"
---

Once you have completed your Offer Wall implementation, test your OfferWall by retrieving test offers, completing them, and confirming that your reward system is functioning properly.

To test your Offer Wall implementation:

1. In the DT Console, set your app status to `TESTING`, as described in [Editing the App Status](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993845721500-Editing-App-Settings#h_01JKCJ7D6WR361PA7VW65A7VQP).
2. Temporarily disable any VPN on the test device.
3. Launch your app and access the Offer Wall you want to test.\
   A list of test offers appears.
4. Verify that the OfferWall displays as configured.
5. Tap any offer titled **DT Test Offer** and complete the offer task.

6. Verify your reward system:

   * If you use server-side rewarding, verify that you are able to receive and process the reward callback from DT.
   * If you use the DT virtual currency server, re-initialize the SDK to retrieve the updated virtual currency balance.

## FAQs

The following FAQs provide answers to some common questions encountered when testing an OfferWall implementation. If you have a question that is not listed or need further clarification, contact your DT Representative.

**Why is my Offer Wall showing up blank?**

Placement configuration errors may cause a blank Offer Wall to display. Check the following configurations:

* Check that your Offer Wall Placement and Default Placement are set to `ACTIVE` status, as described in [Activating or Deactivating a Placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993760743964-Specifying-General-Placement-Settings#h_01JJD43Y0JM073FNZ50EXP06YN).
* Verify that the placement ID in your implementation is for the placement you want to use for the Offer Wall. For more information about SDK implementations, see[Showingthe OfferWall](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132-SDK-Plugin-APIs#01H5X25K7MMDH2QRKMKR7DR8RQ). For REST API implementations that specify a placement, see[`placement_id`](/hc/en-us/articles/16898997163676-feed-v1-offers#PlacementID) for the `/feed/v1/offers`endpoint.
* For Rewarded Actions implementations that do not specify a filtered placement, verify that you are requesting OfferTypeID`114` in the `offer_types`parameter when requesting offers. For more information, see[`offer_types`](/hc/en-us/articles/16898997163676-feed-v1-offers#offer_types) for the `feed/v1/offers`endpoint.

**Why is my Offer Wall not displaying my custom colors and graphics?**

Check the configurations for the following items:

* The placement associated with the Offer Wall is set to `ACTIVE` status, as described in [Activatingor Deactivating aPlacement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993760743964-Specifying-General-Placement-Settings#h_01JJD43Y0JM073FNZ50EXP06YN).
* You configured UI settings for the placement. For more information, see[SpecifyingUISettings](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993803640732-Specifying-UI-Settings).
* You specified the correct placement ID in your implementation. For more information about SDK implementations, see[Showingthe OfferWall](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132-SDK-Plugin-APIs#01H5X25K7MMDH2QRKMKR7DR8RQ). For REST API implementations, see[/feed/v1/offers](/hc/en-us/articles/16898997163676-feed-v1-offers#PlacementID).
* For REST API implementations, check that your user interface correctly references the appropriate graphics and styling elements to properly render retrieved offers within your app. The REST API only provides offer data and does not include visual assets or styling details. For more information, see [OfferWall RESTAPIIntegration](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011061718-Offer-Wall-REST-API-Integration).

**Why don't I see any test offers?**

Verify whether your app is set to `TESTING` status. Only apps in `TESTING` status can receive test offers. For more information, see [Editing the App Status](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993845721500-Editing-App-Settings#h_01JKCJ7D6WR361PA7VW65A7VQP).

**Why didn't I receive any virtual currency?**

Check the following virtual currency configurations:

* If you are using the DT virtual currency server for rewards, check that you have implemented a virtual currency server in your SDK implementation and re-initialize the SDK to trigger retrieval of the latest virtual currency balance. For more information, see [Virtual Currency Settings](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132-SDK-Plugin-APIs#h_01JBGQ735VFTQVC5W6K89FVTCJ).
* If you are using server-side rewarding, check that you received and processed the reward callback from DT. For more information about reward callbacks, see[Server-SideRewarding](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010867817-Server-Side-Rewarding).
* If your app uses multiple virtual currencies, verify that your OfferWall placement specifies the correct virtual currency. For more information, see[SpecifyingGeneral PlacementSettings](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993760743964-Specifying-General-Placement-Settings).
