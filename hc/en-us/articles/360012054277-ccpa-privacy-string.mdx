title: "CCPA   Privacy String"
---

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ([CCPA](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/)) protects the personal information of California residents. It applies to all businesses operating in California. If a California resident uses an app developer's mobile app, CCPA applies to the developer and all relevant partners that process users' personal information.

## Setting the IAB US Privacy String

DT recommends that the first time you gather a user's opt-out (consent), pass it to the SDK before initializing it. The SDK considers the user's opt-out when initializing.

To set the IAB US privacy string, use the following API:

**Objective-C**

```javascript
[[FyberSDK instance] user setIABUSPrivacyString:@"1YNN"];
```



## Clearing Privacy Opt-Out

To clear the user opt-out setting, use the following API:

**Objective-C**

```
[[FyberSDK instance] user clearIABUSPrivacyString];
```
