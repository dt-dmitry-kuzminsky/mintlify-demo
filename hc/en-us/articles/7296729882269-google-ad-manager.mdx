* [Step 1: Retrieve Google Ad Manager parameters](#h_01J50NR70GAQKB6RXK12S7EH1F).

* [Step 4: Test your integration](#h_01JHK5BBR7WWXAYY509CMH8ZHP).

## Step 1. Retrieve Google Ad Manager Parameters

Before retrieving Google Ad Manager parameters, ensure that you have Google Ad Manager ad unit inventory that you want to mediate with DT. For more information about creating Google Ad Manager inventory, see the following Google Ad Manager articles:

* [Create your Google Ad Manager Account](https://admanager.google.com/home/contact-us/).
* [Add your app to Google Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6316896?hl=en\&ref_topic=10130160\&sjid=15898576676715205199-NA).
* [Create an inventory for your app in Google Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/topic/7505593?hl=en\&ref_topic=7506089\&sjid=7192912598589236407-NC).

To set up Google Ad Manager as a DT mediated network, locate the following Google Ad Manager parameters:

| PARAMETER    | DESCRIPTION                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `App ID`     | Unique ID for your app in the Google Ad Manager.        |
| `Ad Unit ID` | Unique identifier for the ad unit in Google Ad Manager. |
| `Bundle ID`  | Unique identifier for your app in the store.            |

For more information about how to locate Google Ad Manager parameters, see [Find an app ID or ad unit ID](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/15014197?hl=en\&sjid=15566666120618356982-NC "Google Ad Manager support documentation for how to find an app ID or ad unit ID."). Once you locate the indicated Google Ad Manager parameters, copy and store these parameters in a text file to reference these values when you add the network to your app in the DT Console. Delete the text file once you finish adding the network in the DT Console.

## Step 2: Add Google Ad Manager as a DT Mediated Network

Before you add Google Ad Manager as a mediated network in DT FairBid:

* Ensure that you have access to parameters you retrieved from Google Ad Manager in [Step1](#h_01J50NR70GAQKB6RXK12S7EH1F).
* [Add your App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308-Adding-an-App) using the DT Console.
* Ensure that you set up a [DT Placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468-Setting-Up-Placements "Create a DT placement") for each Google Ad Manager ad type you want to mediate with DT.

1. Log in to the [DT Console](https://mui-qa.fyber.com/inventory/publisher?startDate=2021-07-07\&endDate=2021-07-13)and click **App Management**.

2) [Set up](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005016082972-Setting-Up-Mediated-Networks) Google Ad Manager as a mediated network using the parameters you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J50NR70GAQKB6RXK12S7EH1F).

3. [Create an instance](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15111147606428-Setting-Up-InstancesF) for each Google Ad Manager placement you want to mediate with DT. Use the Google Ad Manager Ad Unit ID you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J50NR70GAQKB6RXK12S7EH1F) as the **Instance ID**.

## Step 3. Add the Google Ad Manager SDK to your DT Integration

To integrate the Google Ad Manager SDK, follow the instructions on the [Supported Networks](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010077777-Supported-Networks) page.

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Use the DT Test Suite to verify that you have set up your app properly for FairBid mediation. The DT Test Suite is available for Android, iOS, and Unity apps. For more information about using the DT Test Suite, see [Test Suite](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16840582428316-Test-Suite "Using the DT Test Suite").
