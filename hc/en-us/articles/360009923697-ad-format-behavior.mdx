This article outlines the behavior of Interstitial Ads and Rewarded Video Ads. These ad formats differ in user interaction, reward mechanisms, and customization options. The table below summarizes the key behaviors and characteristics of each format.

| Behavior                         | Interstitial Ads                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Rewarded Videos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Ad Display                       | Interstitial ads display during app transitions, such as after level completion or when the app is paused, which enables users to skip the ad after 5 seconds. The ad lasts for 15-30 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Rewarded videos are user-initiated, which enables users to earn rewards after watching the full video (typically 15-30 seconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Close Button                     | iOS: After a 2-second delay, the x-button appears on the top right-hand side. Android: After a 2-second delay, the back button is enabled. Can be overridden by DSP by using MRAID `useCustomClose`, in which case they determine when the x-button is shown in their ad.                                                                                                                                                             | The DT SDK handles the close button after 30 seconds (or sooner, depending on video duration). Partners should not return their own custom close button or employ the `useCustomClose`function for rewarded video, as this could cause issues. As a policy, DT does not allow any videos longer than 30 seconds. Videos exceeding 30 seconds may be blocked. |
| Interactivity and Embedded Games | Interstitial ads offer limited interactivity, which enables users to skip or close the ad after the countdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Rewarded videos, such as embedded games or CTAs, feature more interactivity, which encourages user participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Call to Action                   | The CTA button immediately appears on the bottom right corner, overlaying the video during playback. The user can click the CTA at any time and will be taken to the ad's destination URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rewarded videos allow CTAs integrated at key moments, which drive user interaction and engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Video Playback Behavior          | MRAID video is not supported by DT. DT prohibits DSPs from running in-banner videos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Rewarded videos utilize advanced playback controls, which enable smoother and more interactive viewing experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Video SDK Components             | Interstitial ads use a video playback SDK that supports both Skippable and Non-Skippable options, allowing customization by the publisher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rewarded videos integrate an advanced video SDK with playback controls, countdown timers, and options for interactive features, which enables more customization.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Video Sound                      | Interstitial ads start muted or unmuted, depending on the publisher’s configuration. Users can toggle the sound on or off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rewarded videos start muted or unmuted, based on configuration. Users can adjust sound settings to match the app's audio preferences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Skip and Close                   | Videos of 60 seconds or shorter are both Skippable and Non-Skippable. Videos of 61-120 seconds are Skippable only. Users can skip videos after 5 seconds, with a skip button appearing in the upper right-hand corner. After the user completes or skips the video, DT shows the end card immediately.                                                                                                                               | Rewarded videos have fixed skip and close mechanisms to ensure full viewing for reward eligibility ensuring consistent ad engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Countdown Timer                  | Interstitial ads display a countdown timer. Users can skip the ad after 5 seconds. A countdown timer appears at the bottom left of the video and shows the remaining video duration passed in VAST XML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | A countdown timer appears at the top right corner of the video. Partners should not return their own countdown timer, as this might lead to issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| End Card Sound Button            | Some interstitial ads include a sound button on the end card, which enables users to control sound after the ad ends. The x-button on all video end cards appears on the upper right-hand side after 3 seconds. There is no countdown timer on the end-card x-button. If a DSP provides their own MRAID end card and uses MRAID `useCustomClose`, DT adds a fail-safe x-button to the video end card, which appears after 15 seconds. | The DT SDK presents the end card upon video close if a companion ad is included in the ad markup of the bid response. Rewarded videos have the same end card behavior as non-rewarded videos.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reward Mechanism                 | Interstitial ads do not offer rewards, which enables the focus to be on maximizing user engagement and ad visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Rewarded videos provide rewards (for example, in-app currency or extra lives) once the user watches the full video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
