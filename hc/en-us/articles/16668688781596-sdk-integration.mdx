This article provides instructions for integrating the DT Offer Wall which is included in the DT FairBid SDK. You can integrate DT Offer Wall on Android, iOS, and Unity platforms. Android and iOS require platform-specific setup, whereas Unity uses plugins for integration to simplify the process and ensure cross-platform compatibility. Select the appropriate tab to access platform-specific requirements, setup procedures, and integration methods.

#### Tip

Offer Wall and FairBid are parts of the same integration package, so if you have already integrated FairBid in your app, skip to [OfferWall configuration](/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132).

Android iOS Unity

## Android

#### Current SDK Version: 3.60.0

## Prerequisites

| AndroidAPI          | Android 4.1 (API Level 16) or later. |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Kotlin               | 2.1.0 or later.                      |
| Google Play Services | 11.4.0 or later.                     |

## Tooling

FairBid SDK does not require specific tooling, e.g., Android Studio, Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), Java Development Kit (JDK), and Gradle. However, if you use the following versions of Gradle, use the following versions of AGP and JDK:

| GRADLE       | AGP        | JDK |
| ------------ | ---------- | --- |
| 7.5 or later | 7.4.2      | 11  |
| 8 or later   | 8 or later | 17  |

## Compile and Target SDK

FairBid SDK does not require specific compile or target SDK versions for your app. It maintains compatibility by performing runtime checks for APIs that are not available in the minimum supported version (APILevel16). The highest Android API that FairBid directly utilizes is APILevel30.

## Integration

DT supports both Gradle dependencies and manual downloads to integrate the SDK.

## Gradle

Add DT Maven repository and plugins to your gradle build script:

1. Add the following to your project's root level `build.gradle`file inside the repositories section.
2. At the root level `build.gradle` file, there are usually two repository sections - one for `buildscript` and one for `allprojects`. Add the entry in `allprojects`:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    ...
}
```

3. Add the following to the project app-level `build.gradle` file inside the plugins section (For additional information, see [Types of Gradle Plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block)):

```python
plugins {
    ...
    id 'com.fyber.fairbid-sdk-plugin' version '3.60.0'
    ...
}
```

4. If you support Android SDK below 26, add the following snippet to the Android section (for Java Version Compatibility):

```
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    ...
}
```

## Configuring Your Xcode Project

Configuration of the Xcode projects involves the following steps.

1. [Import System Frameworks](#import-frameworks).
2. [Disable Multitasking](#01H52M1583JZ037KKW7FGASMPZ).
3. [Disable the Linked Products Build Flag](#01H52M15832FM2EGJ12ACHBPG9).
4. [App Transport Security](#01H52M1583G47C1R1TDTPVTMHM).

### Importing System Frameworks

If the **Enable Modules** option(`CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`) is active in the project's Build Settings, there's no need to import any frameworks manually. Import the DT FairBid framework umbrella header in your code, for example, in the AppDelegate class:

**Swift**

```cpp
#import <FairBidSDK/FairBidSDK.h>
```

**Objective-C**

```javascript
import FairBidSDK
```

If you cannot enable modules, you might need to add the following frameworks to the **Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content** section in Xcode:

* `AdSupport`
* `CoreGraphics`
* `CoreLocation`
* `CoreTelephony`
* `MediaPlayer`
* `MessageUI`
* `MobileCoreServices`
* `QuartzCore`
* `Security`
* `StoreKit`
* `SystemConfiguration`

### Disable Multitasking

Select the **Requires full-screen** checkbox from the **General** tab of your Xcode project's target settings page.\
This disables multitasking support, which must be disabled for ads to be able to set the orientation of their views:

</Frame>

### Disable the Linked Products Build Flag

By default, Xcode strips libraries linked to the project. This may result in symbols missing for some ad networks, and subsequently, the DT FairBid SDK may not behave as expected.

To avoid this, set **Strip Linked Products **(`STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT`) build flag to **No**:

</Frame>

### App Transport Security

App Transport Security (ATS) Settings is an Apple security feature that enforces HTTPS connections. Make sure you disable this by setting the **Allow Arbitrary Downloads** property to **Yes** so that you get the HTTP traffic as well. For more information, see [ATS Configuration for DT Exchange SDK](/hc/en-us/articles/17188848003612).



## Unity

#### Current Plugin Version: 3.60.0

## Prerequisites

* Android 4.1 (API level 16) or later, when building for Android
* iOS 11 or later, when building for iOS
* Unity 2021 or later

#### Important

Integrating DT FairBid for Unity iOS development requires a macOS environment. Building your iOS/Xcode project is not supported on Windows.

## Tooling

When integrating the FairBid SDK into your Unity app, make sure your development environment meets the following minimum compatibility requirements.

| UNITY EDITOR | ANDROID SDK  | KOTLIN | GRADLE | JDK | AGP   |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------ | --- | ----- |
| 2022.3       | API Level 16 | 2.1.0  | 7.6.3  | 11  | 7.4.2 |
| 2021.3       | API Level 16 | 2.1.0  | 7.6.3  | 11  | 7.4.2 |

While FairBid *may* work with other Unity Editor versions, DT tests FairBid against these specific versions. Additionally, the recommended tooling (JDK, Gradle, and AGP) versions reflect the defaults included with each Unity version. These can be overridden, but DT recommends using these versions to avoid conflicts in your build process.

## Integration

Digital Turbine supports two methods for the integration in Unity:

1. [Integration through Unity's Package Manager](#01H54C060KV9R4VSDE3FBB311R).
2. [Importing FairBid Unity Plugin Raw Package](#01H54C060K0BESYR5G23DXWKJ1).

## Integrating Through Unity's Package Manager

#### Tip

This is the recommended method to integrate the DT FairBid Unity Pluginin your Unity project.

The DT FairBid Unity Pluginis provided as a package in the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/com.fyber.fairbid.unity) package registry. This package is imported using Unity Package Manager.

To import the package:

1. Add the following entries inside your manifest.json file, which you can find under the Packages folder:
   * Add an entry under `scopedRegistries`. Unity knows where to search when adding the DT FairBid Unity Plugin dependency. This entry points to the NPM package registry.

```javascript
{
    …
    "scopedRegistries": [
        {
            "name": "npmjs",
            "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
            "scopes": [
                "com.fyber.fairbid.unity"
            ]
        }
        …
      ],
    …
  }
  
```

* * Add an entry under `dependencies`, which references the DT FairBid Unity Plugin version that you intend to integrate.

```javascript
{
    …
    "dependencies": {
        "com.fyber.fairbid.unity": "3.60.0",
        …
    }
    …
  }
  
```

2. Save the changes and open your Unity 3D Project.\
   The Unity Package Manager resolves the dependencies, and now the **DTFairBid UnityPlugin** is integrated into the project.
3. Cross-check the DT FairBid integration in Unity 3D by going to **Window→Package Manager**.\
   The Package Manager window shows **DT FairBid** under the DT section and the DT FairBid Unity Plugin version.

You can also change the DT FairBid Unity Plugin version you are integrating through the Unity Package Manager.

## Importing DT FairBid Unity Plugin Raw Package

Follow the instructions below to download the DT FairBid Unity Plugin package manually.

## Manual Download

[**SDK v3.60.0](javascript:void\(0\))

\[] By downloading and/or using this SDK I hereby agree to the [SDK License Agreement](https://www.digitalturbine.com/sdk-license-fyber/)

### Removing Current Plugin

If you are updating the Plugin:

1. Make sure there is no trace of the previous version of the DT FairBid Unity Plugin.
2. Remove the FairBid folder.

This is a fail-safe way to ensure no legacy file is left behind:

</Frame> ](/hc/article_attachments/16668768214556)

### Importing New Plugin

1. Download the DT FairBid Unity Plugin.
2. Unzip the downloaded files.
3. Add the **FairBid**.unitypackage to your open Unity project.

Once you've added the DT FairBid Unity Plugin and [set up your app in the console](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404313469201-Setting-Up-DT-Offer-Wall-), you can [initialize and show the DT Offer Wall](/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132).
