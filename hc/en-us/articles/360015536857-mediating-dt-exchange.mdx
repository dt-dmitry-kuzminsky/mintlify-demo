title: "Mediating DT Exchange"
---

The DT Exchange SDK supports mediation through partner networks for both Waterfall and SDK Bidding models.

Waterfall ranks ad networks based on their average historical performance and prioritizes networks with the highest eCPM, fill rate, and lowest latency. The system sequentially passes impressions from one ad network to the next until they sell.

SDK bidding, or header bidding, enables real-time advertising auctions and allows publishers to auction their ad inventory to multiple sources simultaneously.

The DT Exchange bidder allows DT Exchange to participate in RTB auctions and bid in programmatic exchanges on mediation platforms, which promotes fair competition among media buyers.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="How to switch from Waterfall to Bidding?">

You cannot directly re-purpose a waterfall placement as a bidding placement. Instead, in DT Console, create a new placement, set it up for bidding, and deactivate the old waterfall placement.\
When setting up the placement in your mediation provider's dashboard, pick **DT Exchange** **Bidder **(not **DT Exchange**) as a mediated network.
