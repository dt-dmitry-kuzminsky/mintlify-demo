DT Offer Wall Reporting API Metrics and Dimensions

This guide is intended for Advertisers using DT Offer Wall Reporting API.

This Reporting API enables you to access all the reporting data related to monetization of your DT Offer Wall. You can query multiple metrics such as revenue and impressions across the available dimensions and even implement filters.

For supported metrics and dimensions for Advertisers, see [DT Offer Wall Report Dimensions](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010955997-DT-Offer-Wall-Report#h_01JDHEXHJGGVFHSASDJQAJ31W3).

## DT Offer Wall Reporting API Workflow

The publisher makes a POST request using the Client ID and Client Secret to receive the Access Token, as described in[Step 1](#h_01HGB71V3SHMVFH8838AN5FNG7).

Once the request is successful and the Access Token is received, an API Request is made to create a custom report as described in[Step 2](#h_01HGB71V3TTVMPJ39867JE9DVF). A successful response will contain a URL leading to a file that will be populated with the custom report. More details can be found in[Step 3](#h_01HGB71V3XNFJ78THYWFYZY6ZT).

## Step 1: Obtaining the Access Token

DT's Reporting API uses Access Tokens for authentication purposes. To obtain your Access Token, you must first get your Client ID and Client Secret.

Obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret

1. Sign in to the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/login).
2. On the left menu bar, click**Users.\

   If necessary, you can click <Frame caption="mceclip2.png">
     <img src="https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/article_attachments/6435051161757" />
   </Frame> to delete the current credentials.\
   You are returned to the API Keys window.

6. Click**<Frame caption="mceclip3.png">

Keep your Client ID and Client Secret safe, as they can be reused in the future.

Using your Client ID and Client Secret make a POST request to receive your Access Token.

The base End Point for the entire process is:`https://reporting.fyber.com`

Authentication Token

```bash
POST /auth/v1/token
```

Headers

```python
Content-Type    application/json
```

Sample Request

```ruby
https://reporting.fyber.com/auth/v1/token
```

Params

```python
format  csv
```

Body: raw (application/json)

```json
{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "3ce44d885XXXXXXXXXXa3b752cc9128",
    "client_secret": "YtMvC7VYTQMQ7w9UCUaFTRGJnwVZnQqqN02XNyt8IIh2h8XFDuXXXXXXXXSS6XTrFWW4TkebCcMLJkrXSw5IurkearTJIDzUxsbiMXv8hb4T55MwN6eE7DDIthRFqDnhnuhiDlY2oPeaOjsMbzE8joZ5cs6tsySJz6uZXwJ-x3lcYaYbgXXXXXXXX3_hFeuXm-C7-me2V1MMs-ftJxTd5QbHoUhG3Q5anCWCW_pg8x3CL4yPGCbpWYYZfpdNPyyCT4rxCEb-VC0Bdqwe8N2GGn_VSFOwQYxa-yap2JuNSGJfl_ZURXXXXXXXXFe1GpHDn8pk7yYwQYIGAg"
}
```

**Grant Type**must be "client\_credentials". The credentials are sent according to the **OAuth 2.0 protocol**

## Sample Authentication Response

When an authentication request is successful, you receive the following response in JSON format:

Successful Response

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpABCiOjE1NzAwMTY5MDAsImV4cCI6MTU3MDAyMDUwMCwiYXVkIjoic3BlZWRiYWxsIiwic3ViIjoiMjEwMjYzIn0.hDo1waTytSys_oRhFNUPqZPom26bL05rxgtSt3XYHqI",
  "tokenType": "bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

**accessToken**: The token required to continue the process\
**tokenType**: Bearer\
**expiresIn**: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

When a request is unsuccessful, you receive the following response:

Unsuccessful Response

```json
{
  "error": "internal_server_error"
}
```

## Possible Authentication Errors

Set out in the table are a list of possible errors which resulted in an unsuccessful response.

| HTTP Status Code | Error                    | Scenario                                                                                                                                                  |

## Step 2: Reporting API Request

Use the access token you received in[Step 1](#h_01HGB71V3SHMVFH8838AN5FNG7)to request your custom report.

The request is made up of five individual sections:

* Source
* Date Range
* Metrics
* Splits
* Filters (include)

### Request Example

Source

The below is an example from the DT Offer Wall report. The source can either "performance" or "event" - depending on the view you want to see.

**Performance**based view. Every action/revenue metric, is attributed to the time of the click and impression. This view allows a clear understanding of how your manipulations impact performance.

**Event**based view (Billing). Every action/revenue metric is attributed to the time it happened. This view allows a clear understanding of the periodical revenues conversions and other events, as they happened.**This data pulled from this view matches your monthly billed invoice.**

* Source must be in lower case.

Date Range

Start date: 2019-01-06\
End date: 2019-09-25

Metrics

* Advertiser Spend
* Advertiser ARPU
* Offer Impressions
* Offer Clicks

Splits (dimensions)

* Country

Filters

* Dimension filtered is the country
* Values filtered are US, CA and RU

For a full list of supported Metrics and Dimensions per report, see [Supported Metrics and Dimensions](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010079438-DT-FairBid-Reporting-API#h_01HRSK042CFW2852SHJF9KB88A).

For further descriptions about the terms used in this article, see [Using the Reports](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010045358-Using-the-Reports#h_01J8YSY9GAS4CZT498VVXNCYHV).

URL

```ruby
POST https://reporting.fyber.com/api/v1/report/offerwall?format=csv
```

Headers

```python
Content-Type:   application/json
Authorization: Bearer <Access Token from Authentication Response>
```

Params

```python
format  csv
```

Body. raw (application/json)

```json
{
  "source": "event",
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2019-11-01",
    "end": "2019-12-01"
  },
  "metrics": [
    "Advertiser Spend",
    "Advertiser ARPU",
    "Offer Impressions",
    "Offer Clicks"
  ],
  "splits": [
    "Country"
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "dimension": "Country",
      "values": [
        "GB",
        "US",
        "DE"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If no splits or filters are required, their value should be an empty array. However, source, dateRange and metrics must include a value.

For example:

JSON

```json
{
    "source": "event",
    "dateRange": {
        "start": "2019-06-01",
        "end": "2019-09-25"
    },
    "metrics": [
        "Bid Requests"
    ],
    "splits": [],
    "filters": []
}
```

## Responses

Set out below are examples of both successful and unsuccessful responses.

Response: Successful>

```json
{
  "id": "QQQ",
  "url": "https://fyber-async-offerwall-reports.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/group%AAA/QQQ.csv?AWSAccessKeyId=KKK&Expires=TTTT&Signature=SSS%3D"
}
```

* The "id" field holds an identifier of the request for later troubleshooting, if required.
* The "url" field holds the URL to be polled (GET request) until the body response (file) is populated.

Response: Unsuccessful

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_token"
}
```

## Step 3: Receiving the Custom Report

To obtain the Custom Report, follow the steps below:

1. Receive the URL from the successful response in[Step 2](#h_01HGB71V3TTVMPJ39867JE9DVF).
2. Perform polling on the URL to access the file containing the custom report. The empty file is populated within one hour, depending on the size of the query.
3. If the file is not populated with data after one hour, resend the request.

The URL is valid for three hours.

## Additional Information and Restrictions

It is important to take note of the information, restrictions and rules to ensure the reports provided to ensure a successful response.

General

* All reports are presented in US dollars.
* The time zone used is UTC.

* To receive a breakdown by date, it must exist in the "splits" array.

Date Range Restrictions

There are a number of rules that must be observed with regard to the date range:

## Supported Metrics and Dimensions

You must specify in the API Request the source, metrics, dimensions and optional filters you want to include in your custom report.

* Currently the sources available for the DT Offer Wall Reporting API are Performance or Event.
