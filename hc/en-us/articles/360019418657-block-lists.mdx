title: "Block Lists"

Block lists allow you to specify ads you do not want to appear in your app. You can block ads based on the following ad properties:

* Advertiser: Blocks ads from specified advertiser domains.
* Individual App Campaigns: Blocks ads that promote specific apps to prevent competition or undesired content.
* Creatives: Blocks specific ad creatives by their unique identifiers to manage content at a granular level while allowing the rest of the publisher or website's ads

## Block Lists Levels

You can apply block lists to specific apps in your account or all of the apps in your account:

* All Apps Levels: Applies the block list to all advertisers and affects all apps linked to the advertiser's domain.
* App Level: Applies the block list to specific apps, which targets individual apps or creatives without affecting other ads within the same publisher or advertiser domain. DT automatically adds apps blocked at the app level to the publisher-level blocking list, which ensures comprehensive control of ad content across all apps within the account.

## Viewing Block Lists
