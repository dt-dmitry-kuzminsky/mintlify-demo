Unity Ads currently supports the following [ad types](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010915358-Ad-Types-and-Placement-ID):

* Banner
* Interstitial
* Rewarded

To integrate Unity Ads as a DT mediated network:

* [Step 1: Retrieve Unity Ads parameters](#h_01J8KYBPDGFYWBXMKJF2PBTNN1).
* [Step 2: Add Unity Ads as a Mediated Network](#h_01J539XHGB7SG9M2S82HMH8MGP).
* [Step 3: Add the Unity Ads SDK to your integration](#h_01J539XHGB32CFBR2YVA52Y3ET).
* [Step 4: Test your integration](#h_01JD696125K2HPRR056KHY3B08).

## Step 1: Retrieve Unity Ads Parameters

Before retrieving Unity Ads parameters, ensure that you have Unity Ads ad unit inventory that you want to mediate with DT. For more information about creating Unity Ads as inventory, see the following Unity Ads articles:

* [Create](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/accounts/create-account "Create a Unity Ads account") a Unity Ads account.
* [Create](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/projects/create-project)a Unity Ads Project for your app.
* [Enable ads](https://docs.unity.com/monetization-dashboard/en-us/manual/EnablingUnityAds)for the Project.
* [Create](https://docs.unity.com/monetization-dashboard/en-us/manual/create-ad-units-placements)placements in Unity Ads.

To set up Unity Ads as a mediated Network, locate the following Unity Ads parameters:
