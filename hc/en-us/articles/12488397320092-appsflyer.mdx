## Step 1. Configuring Digital Turbine as an Integrated Partner

1. On the **My Apps** page, locate your app and click on the three dots icon in its top-right corner, pick**Active Integration**, then select **Digital Turbine**:

For iOS

Turn off the **Advanced Privacy **toggle (learn more about Advanced Privacy [here](https://support.AppsFlyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011316197-Advanced-Privacy-guide-postback-macros-for-ad-networks)).

This is required for probabilistic matching to be enabled.

3. Enable the **Install View-Through Attribution** toggle.

For Android

* Enable the **Preload Attribution** toggle.

</Frame>

#### Important

* Preload Attribution requires AppsFlyer SDK 6.6 and later
* Preload Attribution is applicable for on-device inventory only.
* Enabling Preload Attribution gives Digital Turbine longer lookback window options, deterministic matching without a device ID, and preload attribution priority for Digital Turbine above other ad engagements (impressions and clicks). Credit goes to Digital Turbine because the app is installed directly on device as opposed to redirecting to the Store.

- Set the **Preload lookback window** to at least *90 days* (AppsFlyer's recommended default).

#### Tip

To prevent attribution loss post successful app preload, consider extending the lookback window to up to *180* days.

4. From the **Install** dropdown, select *All media sources including organic*. Then enable the **In-app event Postbacks** toggle, and set **In-app events Postback window** to *Lifetime*.

## Step 2. Configuring Event Postbacks

1. Click **Add event**.
2. Map all AppsFlyer events to partner events.

</Frame>

#### Note

Digital Turbine machine learning algorithms rely on standard event names to improve ad targeting, optimization, measurement, and insights. For best results, use these names for event mapping:

* app\_open
* purchase
* level\_achieved
* ad\_click
* ad\_view
* login
* add\_payment\_info
* add\_to\_cart
* add\_to\_wishlist
* checkout\_initiated
* complete\_registration
* complete\_tutorial
* reservation
* update
* subscribe
* search
* view\_content
* credits\_spent
* achievement\_unlocked
* app\_rated
* tutorial\_complete
* social\_share

If there's no suitable name on this list for an event, you can add an arbitrary event name. However, make sure there are no spaces and special characters in it other than the underscore ( *\_ *).

3. For all designated events, select *All media sources, including organic* as sending option.
4. For all designated events, select *Values & revenue*.
5. Click **Save Integration** at the bottom right.

## Step 3. Creating a Tracking Link

1. Under the **Attribution Link** tab, ensure that **Single-platform link** is selected.

#### Note

Currently, Digital Turbine does not support OneLink.

2. Set the **Click-through lookback window**. We recommend setting this to *30 days*.

3) Set the **View-through lookback window**. We recommend setting this to *24 hours*.
4) Click **Save Attribution Link**.
5) Copy and send the two links to your Digital Turbine representative.

## Step 4. Enabling Cost Tracking

This section will guide you in setting up your cost integration between Digital Turbine and AppsFlyer.

1. Go to **Configuration→Active Integrations** and open the **Cost**tab.

#### Note

If you are using another MMP for cost tracking, or an alternate cost reporting method, leave this toggle off to avoid data discrepancies.

3. Under the **Permissions** tab, enable the **Ad network permissions** to view their traffic for your app in their dashboard.

## Step 5. Setting Up a Suppression List With Audiences

#### Note

Digital Turbine requires suppression lists of existing devices through historical audience lists and real-time unattributed install postbacks (set up in a previous section). This section explains how to set up historical audience lists for suppression through AppsFlyer’s Audiences tool and only applies if you have this enabled on your AppsFlyer account.

1. Add an audience by following the steps listed in the [AppsFlyer's support documentation](https://support.AppsFlyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002689186-Audiences-guide#get-started).
2. Go to **Engage→Audiences→Connections**.
3. Click **+ New connection**.

#### Note

If you are creating a new partner connection from within the audience builder, click on **+ Add partner connection** within the **Manage audience connections** window.

4. For the **Partner name**, select *Appreciate*.
5. For the **Connection name**, enter *Digital Turbine*.
