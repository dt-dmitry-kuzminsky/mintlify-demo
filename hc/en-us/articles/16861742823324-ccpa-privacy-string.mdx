title: "CCPA   Privacy String"
---

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ([CCPA](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/)) protects the personal information of California residents. It applies to all businesses operating in California. If a California resident uses an app developer's mobile app, CCPA applies to the developer and all relevant partners that process users' personal information.

## Setting the IAB US Privacy String

DT recommends that the first time you gather a user's opt-out (consent), pass it to the SDK before initializing it. The SDK considers the user's opt-out when initializing.

To set the IAB US privacy string using the following API:

Android iOS Unity

**Java**

```javascript
String privacyString = "1YNN";
UserInfo.setIabUsPrivacyString(privacyString, context);
```

**Swift**

```javascript
FairBid.user().iabusPrivacyString = "1YNN"
```

**Objective-C**

```csharp
[FairBid user].IABUSPrivacyString = @"1YNN";
```

**C#**

```javascript
var privacyString = "1YNN"; 
    UserInfo.SetIabUsPrivacyString(privacyString);
```

To determine what value to use for the US Privacy String, see [IAB US Privacy String](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/blob/master/CCPA/US%20Privacy%20String.md).\
Valid values include:

* `1---`: CCPA does not apply, for example, the user is not a California resident.
* `1YNN`: User does NOT opt out, ad experience continues.
* `1YYN`: User opts out of targeted advertising.

## Clearing Privacy Opt-Out

To clear the user opt-out setting, use the following API:

Android iOS Unity

**Java**

```
UserInfo.clearIabUsPrivacyString(context);
```

**Swift**

```
FairBid.user().clearIABUSPrivacyString();
```

**Objective-C**

```
[[FairBid user] clearIABUSPrivacyString];
```

**C#**

```
UserInfo.ClearIabUsPrivacyString();
```
