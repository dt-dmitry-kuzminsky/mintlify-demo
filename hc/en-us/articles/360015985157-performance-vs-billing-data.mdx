title: "Performance Vs Billing Data"
---

DT offers two different methods to analyze DT Offer Wall event data which refers to actions performed by userse.g. clicks, installs andconversions. The first method is chronologically-based, meaning we aggregate and report on events as they occur in real-time. The second method aggregates event data and attributes it to the first touchpoint that the user had with an offer which is time of click.

* Event data aggregated in chronological order is referred to as **Billing Data** in DT’s reporting tools. It is also what DT uses for billing purposes.
* Event data aggregated to the time of user click is referred to as **Performance Data** in DT’s reporting tools.

## Example

Let’s assume we have an offer that requires a user to install an app and reach level 10. This means, what the advertiser deems as a *conversion* is the user reaching level 10.

## Performance Data

Click, install and conversion data will all be attributed to the time of click, Oct. 1st.

## Billing Data

Click, install and conversion data are attributed to the time each event occurred, Oct 1st, Oct. 5th and Oct. 10th respectively.

## When Should I View Performance Data?

* To assess how running a VCS (Virtual Currency Sale) during the weekend impacted overall revenue and user engagement.
* To evaluate the impact a specific visual change had on the user behaviour e.g. change in DT Offer Wall elements’ color, updated top banner.
* To analyze how changing the exchange rate or the virtual currency affected performance.

## When Should I View Billing Data?

It is recommended to use billing data to track daily/monthly revenue.
