To integrate ironSource as DT mediated network:

* [Step 1: Retrieve ironSource parameters](#h_01J50P77B3CYYMEAZ36BQEC30R "Retrieve ironSource Parameters").
* [Step 2: Add ironSource as a DT mediated network](#h_01J50P77B39H7QKGYQMHM8TREW "Add ironSource as a mediated network in DT").
* [Step 3: Add the ironSource SDK to your integration](#h_01J50P77B3RENMP2JVMGK304PA "Add the ironSource SDK to your DT integration").

## Step 1: Retrieve ironSource Parameters

Before retrieving ironSource parameters, ensure that you have ironSource ad unit inventory that you want to mediate with DT. For more information about creating ironSource inventory, see the following ironSource articles:

* [Create](https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/general/create-an-account-ironsource-ads/ "Create an ironSource account") an ironSource account.
* [Add](https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/general/how-to-add-an-app-to-your-account/ "Add your app to ironSource") your app to ironSource.
* [Create](https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/general/how-to-add-an-app-to-your-account/#step-4 "Create ad units in ironSource") ad units in ironSource.

To set up ironSource as a DT mediated network, locate the following ironSource parameters:

| PARAMETER       | DESCRIPTION                                                                       |

## Step 2: Add ironSource as a Mediated Network

Before you add ironSource as a mediated network in DT FairBid:

* Ensure that you have access to the parameters you retrieved from ironSource in [Step1](#h_01J50P77B3CYYMEAZ36BQEC30R).
* [Add your App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308-Adding-an-App) using the DT Console.
* Ensure that you set up a [DT Placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468-Setting-Up-Placements "Create a DT placement") for each ironSource ad type you want to mediate with DT.

To add ironSource as a DT mediated network:

1. Log in to the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), and click**App Management**.

2) [Set up](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005016082972-Setting-Up-Mediated-Networks) ironSource as a mediated network using the parameters you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J50P77B3CYYMEAZ36BQEC30R).

3. [Create an ad network instance](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15111147606428-Setting-Up-Instances) for each ad type you want to mediate with DT. Use the ironSource `Ad Unit ID` you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J50P77B3CYYMEAZ36BQEC30R) as the **Instance ID**.

## Step 3: Adding the ironSource SDK to your Integration

To integrate the ironSource SDK, follow the instructions on the [Supported Networks](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010077777-Supported-Networks) page.

#### Note

If you use ProGuard, follow the [ironSource instructions for SDK integration](https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/android/android-sdk/# "ironSource SDK integration instructions").

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Use the DT Test Suite to verify that you have set up your app properly for FairBid mediation. The DT Test Suite is available for Android, iOS, and Unity apps. For more information about using the DT Test Suite, see [Test Suite](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16840582428316-Test-Suite "Using the DT Test Suite").
