title: "Using The Reporting API"
---

The DT Offer Wall Reporting API is available daily, with a delay of up to 12 hours from the end of the day UTC. Due to this delay, DT recommends waiting 12 hours after the end of the day UTC before generating a report for the previous day. If you request a report before this time, DT recommends requesting another report after the 12-hour window to ensure a complete data capture from the prior day.

#### Note

* You can request a maximum of 50 reports per day.
* The time range for a report query is limited to 90 days.
* You can request a maximum of 5 dimensions in a single query.
* You must set the Date in the Splits array to receive a breakdown by date.
* Data from the Reporting API is for performance analysis only. At the end of each month, DT shares comprehensive data you can use for billing purposes.

**To pull data via the Offer Wall Reporting API, complete the following steps:**

1. [Obtain an access token](#h_01J1X7JJTTF3R9ZT6DN0M94722).

3. [Download the requested report](#h_01JA2DEFTBNC41P7PHQ6MEPP8H).

5. Send a POST request to the [`/auth/v1/token`](/hc/en-us/articles/16362809136796) endpoint.

## Generating a Report Request

You must include an access token with any report request. For more information about obtaining an access token, see [Obtain an Access Token](#h_01J1X7JJTTF3R9ZT6DN0M94722).

Once you have the access token, send a POST request to the [`/api/v1/report`](/hc/en-us/articles/16363134365980) endpoint to request a custom report. You can specify what data types to include in the report (for a list of supported metrics and dimensions, see [Reporting API Metrics and Dimensions](/hc/en-us/articles/16362505826076)).

#### Note

* All monetary values are in US dollars (USD).
* The time zone is UTC.

## Downloading the Requested Report

To download the requested report, poll the URL (signed\_url) from the successful response to a report request. The URL is valid for three hours.

#### Important

Initial polling of the URL may show no report data. The reporting system may take up to one hour to populate the report according to the report request. The reporting system adds all report data to the empty report at once. Therefore, your report is complete if any data is present in the report. If your report is still not populated with data after one hour, resend the report request.
