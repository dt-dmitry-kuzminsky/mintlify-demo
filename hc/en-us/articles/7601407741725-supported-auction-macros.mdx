DT allows you to substitute macros based on the [OpenRTB API Specification Version 2.5](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-5-FINAL.pdf) in the `nurl` or `burl` fields, or within the tracking pixel in the `adm` field for auctions. The following table describes the supported DT auction macros.
