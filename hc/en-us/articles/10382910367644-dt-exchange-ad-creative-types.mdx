## Display Interstitials

Interstitials are full-screen, static, or interactive ads. They are typically shown during natural transitions throughout your app; for example, on the app open after completing a game level or while waiting for a new view to load.

## Close Button Behavior on Interstitial Display Ads

Unless the DSP is using MRAID`UseCustomclose`, in this case, they determine when the x-button is shown in their ad.

* **iOS**: The x-button appears on the top right-hand side with a 2-second delay
* **Android**: The back button is enabled with a 2-second delay

If the DSP uses the MRAID`useCustomClose`method, they control when the x-button is shown. When MRAID`useCustomClose` is detected, DT enables a fail-safe x-button on the top right corner after 15 seconds (iOS only) to ensure the user can close the ad in the event that the DSP's own close button fails. For Android, the “back” button is enabled after 3 seconds.

## Playables

Playables are fullscreen, interactive ads that give users a mini preview of an app that they can try-out before downloading. Playables should always include a clear Call to Action that encourages users to download or further engage with an app. Playables can also be a key way to discover high-intent users who are interested in your app.

On DT, Playables are:

* Interstitial (Portrait or Landscape)
* Can be followed by an end card. The end card should part of the ad itself, not requiring any SDK control
* All other components of playablea follow the same guidelines as MRAID 2.0 or HTML ads.

## Supported Playable Protocols

MRAID 2.0 is supported per the IAB specification. MRAID 3.0 is not currently supported.

## How to Identify Playable Inventory is Supported Based on the Bid Request

* “imp.instl” : 1 the ad is interstitial or fullscreen

* “banner.battr” : 13 is OMITTED, meaning user Interactive/Embedded Games are allowed

* “banner.API” : 5 indicating support for MRAID 2.0

  * Playables do not need to be MRAID
  * For MRAID playables, if the partner leverages the useCustomClose() function, the close button must appear within 5 seconds

## How Should a Demand Partner Reply with a Playable Ad in the Bid Response?

* * For Playables, the bid response must include “bid.ext.crtype” : “Playable” and “seatbid.bid.attr” : 13

## What's the maximum size for playables?

* * * We don’t have such a limitation. However, the recommended size is 2 MB for optimal performance.

## Closing Behavior

By default, the x-button appears after 2 seconds on the upper right corner

* * * Can a DSP use**MRAID.useCustomClose()**?**Yes**
    * When using MRAID.useCustomClose(), the x-button must appear within 5 seconds
    * When MRAID.useCustomClose() is detected, DT enables a fail-safe x-button on the top right corner after 15 seconds

## Rewarded Video Ads

Rewarded Video Ads (Opt-in ads) are fullscreen video ads offering the user a reward in exchange for watching a video. For example, a user may be offered free currency for an in-app game or free minutes for a text/call app, in exchange for watching the video ad. The publisher always determines the reward given to the user.

## Supported Rewarded Video Protocols

* DT accepts VAST 2.0, 3.0 and 4.x
* Rewarded Video follows the same specification as the video protocol or API framework passed in the bid request, aside from the below details

## Identifying Supported Rewarded Video Inventory (Bid Request)

To identify if Rewarded Video inventory is supported based on the Bid Request, you should look for specific parameters in the bid request:

1. `"video.ext.rewarded": 1`: This parameter is passed when Rewarded Video is supported. If you see `"video.ext.rewarded": 1` in the bid request, it indicates support for Rewarded Video.

2. `"video.ext.rewarded": 0`: DT passes `"video.ext.rewarded": 0` to signal that the bid request does not support rewarded video.

## Responding with a Rewarded Video Ad (Bid Response)

When responding to a bid request with a Rewarded Video ad, you should follow these guidelines:

* * DT accepts VAST 2.0, 3.0, and 4.x for Rewarded Videos. Your bid response should use the VAST version supported by the publisher.
  * Rewarded Video follows the exact specification as the video protocol or API framework passed in the bid request, except for specific details mentioned below.
  * For Rewarded Videos, you should ensure that the ad markup in your bid response adheres to the VAST specifications and includes the necessary tracking and creative elements.

## DT SDK Video Player Elements Specific to Rewarded Video

The DT SDK handles certain video player elements specific to Rewarded Video:

* * **Skip**: Rewarded Video is non-skippable, and no skip button is presented to the user.
  * **Close Button**: The DT SDK handles the close button after 30 seconds (or sooner, depending on video duration). Partners should refrain from returning their own custom close button or employ `useCustomClose()` function for rewarded video, as it could cause issues. The DT SDK presents the end card upon video close if a companion ad is included in the ad markup of the bid response.
  * **End Card**: The DT SDK presents the end card upon video close if a companion ad is included in the ad markup of the bid response. Rewarded videos have the same end card behavior as non-rewarded videos.
  * **Countdown**: A countdown timer immediately appears at the top right corner of the video. Partners should not return their countdown timer, as this might lead to issues.
  * **Duration**: Rewarded Videos must be 30 seconds or less in duration.
  * **Orientation**: DT has no orientation restrictions; they abide by app and device settings. Ensure that your Rewarded Video creative is compatible with both portrait and landscape orientations per the app and device settings.

By following these guidelines and making sure that your bid response matches the specified elements, you can provide a valid Rewarded Video ad in response to the bid request.

## Rewarded Playables

Rewarded Playables (Opt-in ads) are fullscreen, interactive ads that give users a mini preview of an app they can try-out before downloading. Rewarded Playables should always include a clear Call to Action that encourages users to download or further engage with an app. Rewarded Playables can also be a key way to discover high-intent users interested in your app.

DT Rewarded Playables include:

* Placement Type: Rewarded
* Ad Unit Type: Display
* Orientation: Portrait or Landscape
* Ad Size: Full Screen
* Ad Markup: HTML or MRAID 2.0 only. It cannot be a VAST or MRAID video*.* An end card can follow it. The end card should be part of the ad itself, not requiring any SDK

## Supported Playable Protocols

MRAID 2.0 is supported per the IAB specification. MRAID 3.0 is not currently supported.

## Identifying Supported Rewarded Playable Inventory (Bid Request)

To identify if Rewarded Playable inventory is supported based on the Bid Request, you should look for specific parameters in the bid request:

1. `"imp.instl": 1`: This parameter indicates that the ad is interstitial or fullscreen, which may be a suitable placement for Rewarded Playables.

2. `"banner.battr": 13` (OMITTED): This means that user Interactive/Embedded Games are allowed, suggesting support for rewarded playables.

3. `"banner.api": 5`: This parameter indicates support for MRAID 2.0. While playables do not necessarily need to be MRAID, this is a potential indicator of support for interactive ad formats.

4. `"banner.ext.rewarded": 1`: This custom extension flag indicates that the inventory supports rewarded playables.

If these conditions are met in the bid request, it suggests that the inventory supports Rewarded Playables.

## Responding with a Rewarded Playable Ad (Bid Response)

When responding to a bid request with a Rewarded Playable ad, you must include specific values in your bid response:

1. `"bid.ext.crtype": "Playable"`: This field should specify that the creative type is a "Playable" ad.

2. `"seatbid.bid.attr": 13`: This attribute value (13) indicates that the ad is user-interactive or supports embedded games.

If your bid response does not contain these values, it will be dropped, and the ad will not be served as a Rewarded Playable.

Reward Control**\
**
-----------------------------

The control of rewarding in Rewarded Playables is as follows:

* * The user receives their reward once they click on the x-button, which is typically displayed after a specific duration.
  * DT's SDK sends a completion event, and the publisher is responsible for giving the user the reward.
  * Completion events are reported in DT's Dynamic Reports, which include "Rewarded Completions" and "Completion Rate" metrics.
  * Each rewarded playable ad completion is reported in DT's Dynamic Reports, allowing for tracking and analysis.

Duration of a Rewarded Playable

By default, DT displays an x-button on the upper right corner after 30 seconds for Rewarded Playables. On Android, the back button is disabled for 30 seconds or the customClose duration, if set.

## Duration Customization Options

Demand partners (DSPs) can customize the duration and the display of the x-button for Rewarded Playables:

* DSPs can control the duration and present the x-button in less than 30 seconds by using `MRAID.useCustomClose()`. For example, if the DSP sets it for 5 seconds, the user can close the ad and receive a reward after clicking on the x-button within 5 seconds.

* DT adds a fail-safe x-button after 30 seconds when `MRAID.useCustomClose()` is detected to ensure that all ads can eventually be closed by the user.

These customization options allow DSPs to tailor the user experience for Rewarded Playable ads.
