Adjusting the library logging level allows you to receive more information or check for errors. To change the library logging level, call `InneractiveAdManager.setLogLevel` and pass the desired log-level definition.

To debug the Android Library, use the following API:

**Java**

```
InneractiveAdManager.setLogLevel(Log.VERBOSE);
```
