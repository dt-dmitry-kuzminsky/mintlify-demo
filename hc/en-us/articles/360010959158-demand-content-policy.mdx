This Demand Content Policy (“Policy”) sets forth standards that govern Digital Turbine's relationship with its advertisers, agencies, demand-side platforms (DSPs), ad networks, ad exchanges and any other entity bidding on inventory that goes through the DT Exchange (collectively, “Demand Partner(s)”).

We at Digital Turbine believe that establishing, publicly displaying, and obligating our advertising demand partners to adhere to and comply with this Policy is important to protect the trust and transparency between our company and Demand Partners.

All Demand Partners are expected to abide by this Policy and refrain from serving any advertisements via the DT Exchange in breach of this Policy. This Policy provides listing of prohibited advertisement content by Digital Turbine via its Ad Exchange and is by no means exhaustive and may not be inclusive of all objectionable advertising.

We recognize that this Policy cannot address every situation or issue that may arise in the course of doing business, especially given the pace of change within the advertising technology industry, in which we operate. Accordingly, we anticipate that this Policy will be revisited and updated from time to time. In particular, we will remain open to suggestions, criticism, and correction from our Demand Partners. Digital Turbine reserves the right, at any time, to require from its Demand Partners the removal of objectionable advertising. Digital Turbine may block and/or suspend, temporarily or permanently, any Demand Partner access to DT Exchange for non-compliance with this Policy.
