title: "Bid Loss Notifications"
---

Bid Loss Notifications provide DSPs with real-time feedback on a per-impression basis. This allows you to receive auction transparency on pricing and blocks, such as bids below the floor, losses to a higher bidder, or blocked advertisers. Notifications also identify technical issues that prevent successful bids, such as timeouts and invalid domains. This feedback allows you to understand the winning auction's clear price and improve pricing strategies.

#### Note

The partner must be configured as an RTB-enabled bidder on the DT Exchange

Contact your dedicated Programmatic Demand Manager to activate this feature:

* Include the `lurl` in the bid response, which allows DT to fire a loss notification when applicable.
* Provide a static URL endpoint to your Demand Manager for timeout notifications.
* Add the `${AUCTION_PRICE}` macro to your tracking pixel to receive transparency on the winning clear price, and DT returns the winning price in \$USD.
* Add the `${AUCTION_LOSS}` macro to receive the encoded auction loss reason.
* Add the `${AUCTION_MIN_TO_WIN}` macro to receive the minimum bid the bidder needs to win the auction.

## Loss Notifications Errors

#### Important

DT does not support error code 0 (win) for the `lurl` parameter. For win notifications, use the `nurl` parameter.

The following table lists error codes and possible reasons for loss notification errors.

The following example demonstrates how to pass the `lurl` parameter in the bid response to trigger a loss notification.

**JSON**

```bash

## Bid Statuses

The DT ad exchange uses real-time bidding (RTB) protocols to conduct auctions which allow you to filter out or reject bids for various reasons. The following table describes each Bid Status.
