title: "Apple'S App Privacy Details"
---

App privacy details on the App Store, known as Apple's Nutritional Label, provide transparency about data collection. This feature requires every app submission to disclose collected data, including information from third-party sources, such as advertising platforms.

DT provides clear guidance on its data collection practices within [Apple's App Store privacy policies](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) to help you meet this requirement. For each required data type, DT specifies whether it collects this data, how it collects the data, and for what purpose.

## Data Use

DT only collects [data types](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#data-type) with notes in the descriptions in the table below and specifies the purpose for collecting each type. DT uses your data solely for third-party advertising, including displaying ads in your app, or sharing data with entities that display third-party ads.
