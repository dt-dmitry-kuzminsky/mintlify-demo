The General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/)) requires you to protect all users of your app within the European Union by giving them more privacy and allowing them to 'opt-in' to using your app.

DT applies internal processes to anonymize user data and retain the data's value while protecting user identity. For example, when the updated DT SDK detects that a user declines consent, it automatically anonymizes the GPS coordinate data or IP addresses before passing the ad request to demand partners. This maintains that no personal information is processed.

In addition, DT flags its demand partners when a user declines GDPR consent and does not want targeted ads on the app. In such cases, the user receives contextual ads. Contextual ads are ads that are served based on the content of the page, app, or site the user is viewing, rather than personal data.

## SDK APIs

All SDKs include APIs to communicate user consent provided to DT and share their consent to DT's demand partners and mediated ad networks.

#### Note

To comply with GDPR requirements, update the DT SDK in your app. DT also recommends notifying your users to update the app to maintain compliance.

## FAQs

**What are contextual ads?**

Contextual ads are ads that are based on the context of the app rather than on the behavioral preferences or personal data of a particular app’s user. These ads may potentially generate less revenue for the publisher.

**What is DT’s data retention policy?**

DT’s Privacy Policy states that DT stores user data for as long as the user uses the app or site and for a 30 days thereafter, for the purpose of internal reporting, analysis and to provide its services, and may save such data for longer period for invoicing, reporting, discrepancy reasons and to prevent fraud, but in any case, for no longer than 90 days.
