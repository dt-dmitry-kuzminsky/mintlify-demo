title: "Dual End Card"

A Dual End Card is a personalized extension of the ad campaign that gives users a final opportunity to engage with it. The DT Exchange generates it from the bundle information from the open RTB bid, which includes the app name and icon.

DSPs can implement this feature and set the `dualendcard` attribute in the `BidResponse.seatbid.bid.ext`, which sends it for eligible traffic.
