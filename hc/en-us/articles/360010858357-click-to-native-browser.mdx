title: "Click To Native Browser"
---

Demand-side platforms running in-app-to-mobile web campaigns on the DT Exchange track cookies, perform cross-device matching, and measure mobile web conversions. To track cookies after an ad click-through, DT opens the landing page URL in the native browser instead of the default embedded browser. In an embedded browser, DT tracks only device IDs. In a native browser, DT tracks user cookies, bounce rate, and web conversions.

### Custom Extension

**Java**

```javascript
imp.ext.brsrclk:1
//Where [1] = native browser is forced open upon click 
```

3. Append a new URL suffix to their Click URL to force the native browser to open.\
   DT opens the landing page in the embedded browser when you do not append the URL suffix.
