title: "MyTarget"
---

The purpose of this article is to guide publishers who want to use the DT FairBid SDK to load and display ads from myTarget via DT FairBid Mediation.

myTarget currently supports the following [ad formats](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010915358-Ad-Types-and-Placement-ID):

* Banner
* Interstitial
* Rewarded

To integrate myTarget as DT mediated network:

* [Step 1: Retrieve parameters from myTarget](h_01J539MRMV6XZ7WEMT2KN7NSQH).
* [Step 2: Add myTarget as a DT mediated network](#h_01J539MRMV1A5SQ35XYEH0Q0XH).
* [Step 3: Add the myTarget SDK to your integration](#h_01J539MRMVNCXCKJ3PV8PNDV37).
* [Step 4: Test your integration](#h_01JD5M2DKD5GXVP71BKXX4QEET).

## Step 1: Retrieve myTarget Parameters

Before retrieving myTarget parameters, ensure that you have myTarget inventory by completing the following tasks in your myTarget dashboard::

1. [Create](https://target.my.com/help/partners/mob/registration/en) a myTarget account.

2. [Create](https://target.my.com/help/partners/mob/slot/en#app) your App in myTarget.

3. [Create](https://target.my.com/help/partners/mob/slot/en#unit) Ad Units for your app. Ensure that you specify the appropriate [Integration type](https://target.vk.ru/help/partners/mob/inappbidding/en):

   * **SDK/Javascript** for traditional waterfall mediation or
   * **In-app Bidding** for SDK Bidding

To enable myTarget as a DT mediated network, obtain the `Access Token` from your myTarget account. This token allows access to statistics API for all apps and ad units associated with your account. Save this token to a text file for later use in [Step2](#h_01J539MRMV1A5SQ35XYEH0Q0XH "Step 2: Adding myTarget as a DT mediated network").

| MYTARGET PARAMETER | REQUIREDFOR              | DESCRIPTION                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access Token       | Waterfall                 | Allows access to the statistics API of your all apps and ad units associated with your account. |
| App ID             | * Waterfall
* SDK Bidding | Unique identifier for your app in the myTarget system.                                          |
| Slot ID            | - Waterfall
- SDK Bidding | Unique identifier for each ad unit you offer in your App.                                       |

## Obtaining the Access Token

1. From your [myTarget dashboard](https://target.my.com), go to **Profile→AccessTokens**.

</Frame>

2. Click **Show Token**.\
   The Access Token displays.

  <img src="https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/article_attachments/4411043615633" />
</Frame>

3. Copy the `Access Token`, and store the value in a text file. This value is required later in [Step2](#h_01J539MRMV1A5SQ35XYEH0Q0XH "Step 2: Adding myTarget as a DT mediated network") to add myTarget as a DT mediated network.

## Obtaining the App ID and Slot ID

1. From your [myTarget dashboard](https://target.my.com), click the **Apps** tab.\
   A list of your apps displays.

2) For the app you want DT to mediate, copy the `App ID`, and store the value in a text file. This value is required later in [Step2](#h_01J539MRMV1A5SQ35XYEH0Q0XH "Step 2: Adding myTarget as a DT mediated network") to add myTarget as a DT mediated network.

3. From the **Apps** tab, click your App.\
   A list of slots associated with your App display.

4) For each slot that you want DT to mediate, copy the associated `Slot ID`, and store the values in a text file. These values are required later in [Step2](#h_01J539MRMV1A5SQ35XYEH0Q0XH "Step 2: Adding myTarget as a DT mediated network") to add myTarget as a DT mediated network.

## Step 2: Add myTarget as DT Mediated Network

Before you add myTarget as a mediated network in DT FairBid:

* Ensure that you have access to parameters you retrieved from myTarget in [Step1](#h_01J539MRMV6XZ7WEMT2KN7NSQH).
* [Add your App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308-Adding-an-App) using the DT Console.
* Ensure that you set up a [DT Placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468-Setting-Up-Placements "Create a DT placement") for each myTarget ad type you want to mediate with DT.

#### Note

myTarget allows you to configure the following Banner placements (slots) to offer banners on different devices:

* **Banner Ad Unit** is for banner ads (320x50) on phones.
* **Leaderboard Ad Unit** is for banner ads (728x90) on tablets.

To mediate both types of banner placements with DT, use a single DT Banner Placement, and add both myTarget slots as separate network instances.

To add myTarget as a DT mediated network:

1. Log in to the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), and click**App Management**.

2) [Set up](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005016082972-Setting-Up-Mediated-Networks) **myTarget** or **myTarget Bidder** as a mediated network for your app using the parameters you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J539MRMV6XZ7WEMT2KN7NSQH).

  <img src="https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/article_attachments/17930944826908" />
</Frame>

3. [Create an ad network instance](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15111147606428-Setting-Up-Instances) for each placement you want to mediate with DT. Use the myTarget `Slot ID` you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J539MRMV6XZ7WEMT2KN7NSQH) as the **Instance ID**.

## Step 3: Adding the myTarget SDK to your Integration

To integrate the myTarget SDK, follow the instructions on the [Supported Networks](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010077777-Supported-Networks)page.

## Android Integrations

As of myTarget version 5.18.0, the minimum supported AndroidAPI is APILevel21. If your app uses an earlier version than Android APILevel21, DT sends a compilation error message similar to the following:

<Info>
`Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 16 cannot be smaller than version 21 declared in library [com.my.target:mytarget-sdk:5.18.0] ~/.gradle/caches/transforms-3/510343f8c577f4ba829d8544359f788b/ transformed/jetified-mytarget-sdk-5.18.0/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 16. Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 16,or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 21, or use tools:overrideLibrary="com.my.target" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)`

</Info>

If you cannot increase the minimum supported Android API for your App or remove myTarget from your integration, DT and Gradle suggest using the following modification to the AndroidManifest to override any conflicts between myTarget and your application.

```html
<manifest
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        package="com.example.sample">

<uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary="com.my.target"/>
```



#### Warning

On devices running versions earlier than Android APILevel21, this modification prohibits the start the myTarget SDK which results in no fills from myTarget.

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Use the DT Test Suite to verify that you have set up your app properly for FairBid mediation. The DT Test Suite is available for Android, iOS, and Unity apps. For more information about using the DT Test Suite, see [Test Suite](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16840582428316-Test-Suite "Using the DT Test Suite").
