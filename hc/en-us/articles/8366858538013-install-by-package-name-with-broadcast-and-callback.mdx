To receive updates, you can pass both callback and broadcast information.

```java
// Initialization

// Install application via package name string and listen to updates using callback and broadcast receiver action
val packageName = "com.package.name"
IgniteServiceSdk.instance().install(packageName, buildInstallationCallback(), action = buildInstallAction())

// ...

// See implementations of buildInstallationCallback() and buildInstallAction() in examples above
```
