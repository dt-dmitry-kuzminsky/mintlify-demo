title: "DT Exchange OpenRTB 2.5 Specs"
---

OpenRTB (Real-Time Bidding) was initially built to standardize communication between parties for blocking inventory. It has since evolved into a standardized API protocol designed to automate the real-time trading of digital media across a range of platforms, devices, and advertising solutions.

DT supports OpenRTB versions 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5; older versions are incompatible. DT encourages Buyers to upgrade their integration to latest DT OpenRTB 2.5 specification to benefit from all supported parameters.

This article references the [OpenRTB API Specification Version 2.5](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-5-FINAL.pdf). The following sections detail the Open RTB parameters that DT supports and the associated values we send.
