#### Note

iOS campaigns where probabilistic matching is desired require specific privacy settings:

3. From the** Media Partner** drop-down, select *Digital Turbine - Android *and click **Go**.

## Step 3. Setting Up Install Postbacks

1. Click the** ⋮ **icon for the **Install event Postback**, and select **Edit** from the drop-down menu.
2. For the **App Store ID**, enter your app’s **bundle ID/package name**. Leave the Digital Turbine **App ID** blank.
3. Configure the settings as shown below and click **Save**.

| **Settings**   | **Value**         |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Delivery Delay | Realtime Delivery |
| Retry Attempts | 3 Attempts        |
| Deliver Method | All               |

4. Configure Post-Install event postbacks.

* Required Events:

  * SessionBegin
  * Any event used for a KPI or optimization (ex: purchase, level, reached, first delivery).

* Recommended Events:

  * Any event used for secondary KPIs.
  * Any event used for upper funnel metrics that are leading indicators of primary KPIs (ex.: registration, tutorial complete, add to cart).

5. Locate the desired post-install event, click the **⋮** icon, and select *Create* from the drop-down menu.
6. For the **App Store ID**, enter your **app’s bundle ID/package name**. Leave the Digital Turbine **App ID** blank.
7. If there is a ROAS target, check the **Send Revenue Data** checkbox for events with a revenue value (ex.: purchase, adview, checkout).

</Frame>

#### Note

Digital Turbine machine learning algorithms rely on standard event names to improve ad targeting, optimization, measurement, and insights. For best results, use these names for event mapping:

* app\_open
* purchase
* level\_achieved
* ad\_click
* ad\_view
* login
* add\_payment\_info
* add\_to\_cart
* add\_to\_wishlist
* checkout\_initiated
* complete\_registration
* complete\_tutorial
* reservation
* update
* subscribe
* search
* view\_content
* credits\_spent
* achievement\_unlocked
* app\_rated
* tutorial\_complete
* social\_share

If there's no suitable name on this list for an event, you can add an arbitrary event name. However, make sure there are no spaces and special characters in it other than the underscore ( *\_ *).

9. Select the following settings:

| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Delivery Delay | Realtime Delivery |
| Retry Attempts | 3 Attempts        |
| Deliver Method | All               |

10. Click **Save**. Repeat Steps 6-10 for any additional post-install events that you need to send to Digital Turbine.

## Step 4. Setting Up Lookback Windows

For proper attribution, ensure that you set up lookback windows.

1. Go to **Apps & Assets→PartnerConfiguration**, click the ⋮ icon for your app, and select *Reconciliation* from the drop-down menu.
