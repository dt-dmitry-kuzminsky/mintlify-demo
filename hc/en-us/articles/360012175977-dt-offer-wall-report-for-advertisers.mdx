The DT Offer Wall Report for Advertisers has two different views:

### **Performance**

Every action or revenue metric is attributed to the time of the click and impression. Impression allows a clear understanding of how your manipulations to bid, targeting, or offer creatives impact the performance of your campaigns.

### **Billing**

Every action or revenue metric is attributed to the time it happened. This view allows a clear understanding of the periodical revenues, conversions, and other events as they happened.
