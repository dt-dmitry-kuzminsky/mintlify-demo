* Banner
* Interstitial
* Rewarded

To integrate Ogury as an mediated network in DT FairBid:

* [Step 1: Retrieve Ogury parameters](#h_01J539QP82HYAHMWT2R63TYAEC).
* [Step 2: Add Ogury as a DT mediated network](#h_01J539QP82V4K3YNX781N4B75V).
* [Step 3: Add the Ogury SDK to your integration](#h_01J539QP82YKZ2NX6HZKTM51WS).
* [Step 4: Test your integration](#h_01JD5M8N4SJ1WYNAFZRY18PEN6).

## Step 1: Retrieve Ogury Parameters

Before retrieving Ogury parameters, ensure that you have Ogury ad unit inventory that you want to mediate with DT. For more information about creating Ogury inventory, see the following Ogury articles:

* [Create](https://support.ogury.com/help-center-for-publishers/set-up-ogury-global-demand/setup-your-accounts "Create an Ogury account") an Ogury account.

* [Add](https://support.ogury.com/help-center-for-publishers/set-up-ogury-global-demand/how-to-create-an-asset "Add your app (asset) to Ogury") your app (asset) to Ogury.

* [Create](https://support.ogury.com/help-center-for-publishers/set-up-ogury-global-demand/how-to-create-an-ad-unit "Create ad units in Ogury") ad units in Ogury. Ensure that you specify the appropriate **Ad Unit Integration type**:

  * **Standard** for traditional waterfall mediaton or
  * **Header Bidding** for SDK Bidding.

Locate the following Ogury parameters, and store the values in a text file. These values are required later in [Step2](#h_01J539QP82V4K3YNX781N4B75V) to set up Ogury as a DT mediated network.

| OGURY PARAMETER | REQUIREDFOR              | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

- SDK Bidding | Unique ID assigned to your Ogury ad unit. For more information about how to locate your Ogury Ad Unit IDs, see Ogury's documentation on [locating your Ad Unit ID](https://support.ogury.com/help-center-for-publishers/set-up-ogury-global-demand/how-to-create-an-ad-unit#find-your-a-d-unit-id). |

## Step 2: Add Ogury as a Mediated Network

Before you add Ogury as a mediated network in DT FairBid:

* Ensure that you have access to the parameters you retrieved from Ogury in [Step1](#h_01J539QP82HYAHMWT2R63TYAEC).
* [Add your App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308-Adding-an-App) using the DT Console.
* Ensure that you set up a [DT Placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468-Setting-Up-Placements "Create a DT placement") for each Ogury ad type you want to mediate with DT.

To add Ogury as a DT mediated network:

1. Log in to the [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/), and click**App Management**.

2) [Set up](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15005016082972-Setting-Up-Mediated-Networks) **Ogury** or **Ogury Bidder** as a mediated network for your app using the parameters you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J539QP82HYAHMWT2R63TYAEC).

</Frame>

3. [Create an ad network instance](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/15111147606428-Setting-Up-Instances) for each placement you want to mediate with DT. Use the Ogury `Ad Unit ID` you retrieved in [Step1](#h_01J539QP82HYAHMWT2R63TYAEC) as the **Instance ID**.

## Step 3: Adding the Ogury SDK to your Integration

To integrate the Ogury SDK, follow the instructions on the [Supported Networks page](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010077777-Supported-Networks).

#### Note

The `app-ads.txt` standard helps prevent the unauthorized selling of in-app inventory and app domain spoofing. To maximize your fill rate from Ogury, follow the [Ogury instructions](https://support.ogury.com/help-center-for-publishers/set-up-ogury-global-demand/update-your-app-ads.txt) for adding Ogury as an authorized seller of your inventory.

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Use the DT Test Suite to verify that you have set up your app properly for FairBid mediation. The DT Test Suite is available for Android, iOS, and Unity apps. For more information about using the DT Test Suite, see [Test Suite](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16840582428316-Test-Suite "Using the DT Test Suite").
