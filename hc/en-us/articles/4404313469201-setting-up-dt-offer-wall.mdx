---

To set up apps and offer placements on DT Offer Wall, you must have access to the DT self-service web dashboard, [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/). Signing in to the DT Console requires a confirmed DT Publisher account. For more information, see [Signing Up for DT Console](/hc/en-us/articles/17532003308828) and [SigningIn to the DTConsole](/hc/en-us/articles/14938196763164).

Once you have DTConsole credentials, set up your app for DTOfferWall:

* [Step 1: Add your app](#AddApp)
* [Step 2: Locate your SDK credentials](#SDKCreds)
* [Step 3: Add placements to your app](#AddPlacements)
* [Step 4: Set up reward handling](#Rewards)
* [Step 5: Activate your app](#GoLive)

## Step1:AddYourApp

The DT Console allows you to add your app whether or not it is published in an app store. When you add your app, you specify settings for a default placement. This default placement can serve as your active Offer Wall placement, or it can serve as a fallback placement should your active placement become unavailable.

To add your app using the DT Console:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→OfferWall** and click **AddApp**.
2. Enter details about your app and click**Next**.
3. Enter settings for the virtual currency to apply to the default placement and click**Next**.
4. Enter settings for the default placement.
5. Click **Addapp**.

For more information, see [Adding an App](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17868539530524-Adding-an-App).

## Step2: Locate Your SDK Credentials

Integrating the SDK for DT Offer Wall requires your DT OfferWall AppID and securetoken. DT automatically assigns these credentials to your app when you add your app to the DT Console.

To locate your SDK credentials:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→OfferWall** and click your app.
2. On the **Settings** tab, go to **SDKConfiguration**.
3. Copy the listed credentials.

## Step3: AddPlacements to YourApp

You can add multiple placements to one app, and you must have at least one active placement to monetize your app. For each placement, you can define specific UI configurations and virtual currencies.

To add a placement to your app:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→OfferWall** and click your app.
2. On the **Placements**tab, click **AddPlacement**.
3. Enter placement details (general configurations and UI settings) and click **Create**.\

## Step4: Set Up Reward Handling

You can implement different rewarding strategies to handle rewards for completing offers. Once you have decided on a rewarding strategy, indicate your reward handling method in the DTConsole.

To set up your reward handling:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→OfferWall** and click your app.
2. On the **Settings** tab, go to **RewardHandling**.
3. Select the reward method and click **Save**.\
   For more information, see [Setting Up Reward Handling](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993932024348-Setting-Up-Reward-Handling).
4. If you use server-side rewarding, test a callback to ensure your server endpoint is able to receive reward callbacks from DT. For more information, see [Sending Test Callbacks](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/17993961271452-Sending-Test-Callbacks).

## Step5: Activate Your App

After setting up your app in the DT Console, implementing the Offer Wall SDK, and testing your implementation, go live with your integration by changing your app status from `TESTING` to `ACTIVE`.

To change your app status:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→OfferWall** and click your app.
2. On the **Settings** tab, go to **General**.
3. For **Status**, select **ACTIVE**.
4. Click **Save**.
