title: "Reconnect To Ongoing Installation"
---

By default if you call **`install()`** again for the same application SDK will try to reconnect to the task if it is still available.

It is recommended to specify a way of receiving status at least to receive the **`taskId`** of the installation. Later it can be used to get the task information manually (e.g. after a reboot happens).
