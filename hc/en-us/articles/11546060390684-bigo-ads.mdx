  * **Waterfall** for traditional Waterfall
  * **Server Bidding** for SDK Bidding

To set up BIGO Ads as a DT mediated network, locate the following BIGO Ads parameters:

| BIGO ADS PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `App ID`           | The unique ID of your app in the BIGO Ads system. |
