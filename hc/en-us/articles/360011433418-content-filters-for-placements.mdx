title: "Content Filters For Placements"
---

After you complete setting up your app and placement, you can add content filters to control which offer types appear on each placement or across your entire app.

A placement represents the location of the Offer Wall within your app. You can add multiple placements within one app, providing you more control over the content shown in each DT Offer Wall Placement.

Create a category filter to prevent offers from specific categories or task types from appearing in selected DT Offer Wall placements.

## Adding Category Filters

To add a Category Filter, complete the following steps:

1. In [DT Console](https://console.fyber.com/applications), go to **Montetization→Offer Wall**.\
   The **Offer Wall Publisher Dashboard** appears.

Adding too many category filters for your apps can decrease your revenue.

## Creating a Survey-Only DT Offer Wall

A common use for Content Filters is creating a Survey-Only DT Offer Wall. This configuration shows only surveys, which users can complete easily and have a higher engagement. Surveys provide feedback for advertisers and generate revenue for publishers.

To add a Survey-Only Content Filter, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new [placement](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404313469201-Setting-Up-DT-Offer-Wall#h_01G1QS1CE9V9Y8V98TZ8B8QH3F) in the Publisher Dashboard and name it `Survey`.
