From version 3.41.1 and onwards DT FairBid and DT Offer Wall are now integrated with the same SDK! If you are already using DT FairBid in conjunction with DT Offer Wall, make sure to remove the old Unity Plugin `FyberSDK`from your project and **use only** `com.fyber.fairbid.unity` from now on, we recommend using the [Unity Package Manager](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16668688781596-SDK-Integration#01H54C060KV9R4VSDE3FBB311R). Check out our updated [DT Offer Wall SDK Integration Guide](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16668688781596-SDK-Integration#h_01JBGXQ6MTH7A7J2BTHNZSNDZN) and [SDK Plugin APIs](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/16605723967132-SDK-Plugin-APIs) to help you integrate and monetize with DT Offer Wall.
