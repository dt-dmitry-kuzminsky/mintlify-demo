title: "Rewarding Your Users"
---

In your OfferWall implementation, include a reward handling method to credit user accounts when they complete offers. Use one of the following rewarding handling methods in your Offer Wall integration: Server‑SideRewarding and DTVirtual CurrencyServer.

The following table provides a comparison of the reward handling methods. Choosing the best method for your app is not always straightforward, as there are tradeoffs for each option. In general, the decision is usually between*more security*or*more speed*. When implemented properly, both methods provide rewards in a reliable manner that is difficult to fraud, and you can switch between the two methods if needed.

| OVERVIEW       | DT sends reward callbacks directly from DT servers to your designated rewards endpoint. Every callback includes information on who and how much to reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Check for updated reward balances from a secure DT Virtual Currency Server. This rewarding method is best for publishers that lack the infrastructure for server-side rewarding or would rather implement rewarding in the app itself.                                                |
| SECURITY       | All traffic directly related to crediting the reward is completely outside the control or visibility of the user. No sensitive traffic goes through the user’s device. This isolation of reward data reduces the chance for fraud.You can specify additional layers of security by having DT include a unique transaction ID in every reward callback. This parameter adds a universally unique identifier that you can validate against a list of IDs of processed callbacks. Additionally, DT can also include a secure ID that is a SHA1 hash of callback parameters and the security token entered in the DTConsole.Lastly, allowlisting only the IP addresses associated with DT Offer Wall servers ensures that you only receive reward notifications from these specific DT servers. | The DT Virtual Currency Server validates rewards before crediting the user's balance. It does not completely remove the user from the flow of rewarding, as the user must re‑initialize the OfferWall SDK to trigger retrieval of the latest virtual currency balance.               |
| SPEED          | Reward callbacks are real-time reward notifications. Immediately upon logging an offer completion, DT sends the reward callback to your dedicated rewards endpoint. Process the callback upon receipt, and grant the reward to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Initialization of the Offer Wall SDK triggers retrieval of the latest rewards balance from the DT Virtual Currency Server. Because the app must initiate the retrieval of rewards from the DT Virtual Currency Server, users may experience a delay in receiving rewards.             |
| IMPLEMENTATION | You must provide a dedicated endpoint to receive reward callbacks, and respond after processing the reward.
