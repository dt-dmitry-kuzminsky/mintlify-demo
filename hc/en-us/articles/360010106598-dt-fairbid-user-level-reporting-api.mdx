User Level Reporting API Metrics and Dimensions

The DT FairBid User Level Reporting API enables you to access reporting data to measure all revenue generated from individual users. This information can be used to optimize retargeting campaigns and accurately measure user lifetime value.

You can query revenue and impression metrics across the available dimensions. For all supported metrics and dimensions for the User Level Reporting API, click the Metrics and Dimensions tab above.

Some programmatic networks do not disclose their exact CPM bids to publishers for the purpose of calculating user-level revenues. In such cases, DT uses approved methods to base the user-level revenue calculations on close estimates. When a non-disclosing network wins an impression we calculate the price of the impression based on the second-highest bid of every auction and perform a revenue aggregation on a user level. This value is close to the actual revenue generated for impressions and therefore for the users, too.

Naturally, when estimates are being used, gaps in total revenues are formed. Therefore, in every report that includes non-disclosing networks, we will add a row called "aggregated masked user level revenue". This row, not representing a real user, accounts for any gap in total daily revenues that may be formed. That way, when you compare the total revenue generated from the user-level reporting APIs to those generated from less granular reporting APIs, the sum of revenues will be equal.

The User Level Reporting API is disabled by default for any new app onboarding. To enable it, contact your Account Manager. Once enabled, data is aggregated from six days prior to the activation date.

## Reporting API Workflow

The publisher makes a POST request using the Client ID and Client Secret to receive the Access Token, as described in[Step 1](/hc/en-us/articles/360010106598-FairBid-User-Level-Reporting-API#step-1-obtaining-the-access-token-0-2).

Once the request is successful and the Access Token is received, an API Request is made to create a custom report as described in[Step 2](/hc/en-us/articles/360010106598-FairBid-User-Level-Reporting-API#section-step-2-reporting-api-request). A successful response will contain a URL leading to a file containing the custom report. More details can be found in[Step 3](/hc/en-us/articles/360010106598-FairBid-User-Level-Reporting-API#section-step-3-receiving-the-custom-report).

## Step 1: Obtaining the Access Token

DT's Reporting API uses Access Tokens for authentication purposes. To obtain your Access Token, you must first get your Client ID and Client Secret. Read [here](/hc/en-us/articles/4410353843345) on how to obtain these.

**Make a POST request**

The base End Point for the entire process is:`https://reporting.fyber.com`

**Authentication Token**

```bash
POST /auth/v1/token
```

**Headers**

```python
Content-Type    application/json
```

**Sample Request**

```ruby
https://reporting.fyber.com/auth/v1/token
```

**Params**

```python
format  csv
```

**Body: raw (application/json)**

```json
{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "3ce66d885XXXXXXXXXXa3b752bb9058",
    "client_secret": "YtMvC7VYTQMQ7w9UCUaFTRGJnwVZnQqqN02XNyt8IIh2h8XFDuXXXXXXXXSS6XTrFWW4TkebCcMLJkrXSw5IurkearTJIDzUxsbiMXv8hb4T23MwN6eE7DDIthRFqDnhnuhiDlY2oPeaOjsMbzE8joZ5cs6tsySJz6uZXwJ-x3lcYaYbgXXXXXXXX3_hFeuXm-C7-me2V1MMs-ftJxTd5QbHoUhG3Q5anCWCW_pg8x3CL4yPGCbpWUDZfpdNPyyCT4rxCEb-VC0Bdqwe8N2GGn_VSFOwQYxa-yap2JuNSGJfl_ZURXXXXXXXXFe1GpHDn8pk7yYwQYIGAg"
}
```

**Grant Type**must be "client\_credentials". The credentials are sent according to the **OAuth 2.0 protocol**.

**Sample Authentication Responses**

When an authentication request is successful, you receive the following response in JSON format:

**Successful Response**

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NzAwMTY5MDAsImV4cCI6MTU3MDAyMDUwMCwiYXVkIjoic3BlZWRiYWxsIiwic3ViIjoiMjEwMjYzIn0.hDo1waTytSys_oRhFNUPqZPom26bL05rxgtSt3XYHqI",
  "tokenType": "bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

**accessToken**: The token required to continue the process\
**tokenType**: Bearer\
**expiresIn**: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

When a request is unsuccessful, you receive the following response:

**Unsuccessful Response**

```json
{
  "error": "internal_server_error"
}
```

**Possible Authentication Errors**

Set out in the table is a list of possible errors which resulted in an unsuccessful response.

## Step 2: Reporting API Request

Use the access token you received in[Step 1](/hc/en-us/articles/360010106598-FairBid-User-Level-Reporting-API#step-1-obtaining-the-access-token-0-2)to request your custom report.

The two dimensions that you can query in your request are:

* Date
* App ID

All other dimensions always appear in the report.

**Request Example**

Below is presented a POST request to receive a User Level report for the following criteria:

* Date: 2020-02-16
* AppID: 123

**URL**

```ruby
https://reporting.fyber.com/api/v1/report/user-level-data
```

**Headers**

```python
Content-Type:   application/json
Authorization: Bearer <Access Token from Authentication Response>
```

**Body. raw (application/json)**

```bash
{
    “date”: “2020-01-01",
    “appId”: “123"
}
```

**Responses**

Set out below are examples of both successful and unsuccessful responses.

**Response: Successful**

```json
{
  "id": "6fad42cb-25db-4af0-8988-1e7d8e6d90bc",
  "url": "https://fyber-async-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/group%3D210263/6fad42cb-25db-4af0-8988-1e7d8e6d90bc.csv?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAQBQNZ5FY23OTK4UD&Expires=1570020564&Signature=LbhE5uljlPEKQRTbepDqmDgJuFQ%3D",
}
```

* The "id" field holds an identifier of the request for later troubleshooting, if required.
* The "url" field holds the URL to be polled (GET request) until the body response (file) is populated.

**Response: Unsuccessful**

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_token"
}
```
