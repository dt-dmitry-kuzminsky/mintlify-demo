title: "LGPD"
---

The Brazilian General Data Protection Law, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais ([LGPD](https://lgpd-brazil.info/)), requires you to scope your user consent. The LGPD applies if any of the following is conditions are met:

* The user is currently located in Brazil.
* The user registers with the app as a Brazilian resident.
* The app specifically targets Brazilian users.

For more information about how DT applies LGDP, see [LGPD](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/7018487827345-LGPD).

DT recommends that the first time you gather a user's consent, pass it to the DT FairBid SDK before initializing it. The SDK considers the user's consent when initializing. For future sessions, call the API if the user updates their consent, as the SDK caches the consent.

#### Note

If you do not pass the user's consent to the DT FairBid SDK, the SDK only shows contextual ads to that user, which might negatively reduce your revenue.

## User Consent Given

To indicate that the user gives consent, use the following API:

Android iOS Unity

**Java**

```javascript
UserInfo.setLgpdConsent(true, context);
      // true if you have the user’s consent
```

**Swift**

```javascript
FairBid.user().setLGPDConsent = true
```

**Objective-C**

```csharp
[FairBid user].setLGPDConsent = true;
```

**C#**

```javascript
UserInfo.SetLgpdConsent(true);
```

## User Consent NOT Given

To indicate that the user does not give consent, use the following API:

Android iOS Unity

**Java**

```javascript
UserInfo.setLgpdConsent(false, context); 
      // false if you have the user’s consent
```

**Swift**

```javascript
FairBid.user().setLGPDConsent = false
```

**Objective-C**

```csharp
[FairBid user].setLGPDConsent = false;
```

**C#**

```javascript
UserInfo.SetLgpdConsent(false);
```
