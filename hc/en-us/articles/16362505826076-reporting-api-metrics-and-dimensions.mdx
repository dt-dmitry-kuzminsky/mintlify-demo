title: "Reporting API Metrics And Dimensions"
---

The [Offer Wall Reporting API](/hc/en-us/articles/360011061338) enables you to access all the reporting data from DT Offer Wall. You can query multiple metrics, such as revenue and impressions, across the available dimensions and implement filters. Metrics define what type of data you want to include in your report. Dimensions allow you to filter the data set based on specific values. Names of metrics and dimensions are case-sensitive. Currently, the sources available for the DT Offer Wall Reporting API are Performance or Event:

* Performance-based view. Every action or revenue metric is attributed to the time of the click and impression. This view provides a clear understanding of how your settings impact performance. All related data is taken from the Performance View in the DT Offer Wall Report.
* Event-based view (billing). Every action or revenue metric is attributed to the time it happened. This view allows a clear understanding of the periodical revenue conversions and other events as they happened. All related data is taken from the Billing View in DT Offer Wall Report. The data pulled from this view matches your monthly billed invoice.
