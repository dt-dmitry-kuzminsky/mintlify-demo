To set up apps and offer placements on the DT Exchange, you must have access to the DT self-service web dashboard, [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/). Signing in to the DT Console requires a DT Publisher account.

For more information, see articles on [Signing Up for DT Console](/hc/en-us/articles/17532003308828) and [SigningIn to the DTConsole](/hc/en-us/articles/14938196763164).

Once you have the credentials and your account has been confirmed, configure your app:

* [Step1: Add your app](#step-1%3A-add-your-app).
* [Step2: Add placements to your app](#step-2%3A-add-placements-to-your-app).

## Step 1: Add Your App

The DT Console allows you to add your app whether or not it is published in an app store. When you add your app, you can either add placements at the same time or add your placements after adding your app.

To add your app using the DT Console:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→AppManagement**, and click **AddApp**.
2. Enter details about your app.\
   For more information, see our [Adding an App](/hc/en-us/articles/14755391313308)article.
3. Enter placements for your app as described in [Working with Placements When Adding an App](/hc/en-us/articles/14815749727260), or skip this step now and add them later.
4. Click **Addapp**.

## Step 2: Add Placements to Your App

You can add multiple placements to one app, and you must add at least one placement to monetize your app. For each placement, you can define a specific ad format, configuration, and delivery rules to maximize performance.

To add a placement to your app:

1. In the [DTConsole](https://console.fyber.com/), go to **Monetization→AppManagement**, and click your app.
2. On the **Placements**tab, click **Addplacement**.
3. Enter basic placement details (ad type, floor price, and name), and click **Add** at the end of the new placement row.\
   For more information, see [SettingUpPlacements](/hc/en-us/articles/15005035293468).
4. To configure additional placement settings (targeting, refresh rate, capping, pacing, etc.), click the newly added placement, enter the desired settings, and click **Save**.
