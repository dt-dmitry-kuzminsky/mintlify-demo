The Ignite Services Client SDK can log some information on the client side. Each log entry on the client side is also logged locally and back to Ignite via AIDL. Method declaration in **`IIgniteServiceAPI.aidl`**:

```java
  void log(int priority, String message)
```

## Logging Example

```typescript
// ...
api?.install(data, object: IIgniteServiceCallback.Stub() {
     override fun onStart(data: String?) {
          api?.log(Priority.INFO, "Installation started for $data")
          // other code
     }

     // ...
}
// ...
```
