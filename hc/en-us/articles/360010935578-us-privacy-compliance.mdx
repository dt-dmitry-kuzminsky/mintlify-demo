The IAB US Privacy String is a standardized string defined by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) to communicate a user’s privacy preferences under US state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## Setting the IAB US Privacy String

DT recommends that the first time you gather a user's opt-out (consent), pass it to the SDK before initializing it. The SDK considers the user's opt-out when initializing.

To set the IAB US privacy string using the following API:

**Java**

```javascript
String privacyString = "1YNN";
UserInfo.setIabUsPrivacyString(privacyString, context);
```

To determine what value to use for the US Privacy String, see [IAB US Privacy String](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/blob/master/CCPA/US%20Privacy%20String.md).\
Valid values include:

* `1---`: CCPA does not apply, for example, the user is not a California resident.
* `1YNN`: User does NOT opt out, ad experience continues.
* `1YYN`: User opts out of targeted advertising.

## Open Source CCPA String Builder

To help publishers comply with US Privacy requirements and reduce implementation errors, DT provides an open-source project. The open-source project allows you to generate a US Privacy string for your app. The following links provide platform-specific implementation details:
