title: "Supported Macros"

Tracking URLs capture click data from the DTplatform and send it to your tracking platform. These URLs use macros to dynamically insert key details such as campaign name, user ID, and device information.

## Inserting Macros into Your Tracking URLs

To track transactions effectively, include the appropriate macro for each required data point in the corresponding parameter or token. If you're unsure which data points to include, consult your tracking platform for specific requirements.

Digital Turbine integrates with many tracking platforms. Check with your platform if they provide a DT-compliant tracking URL with the required parameters and macros.

#### Note

Make sure to replace the generic Click URL macro placeholder with the proper key name.

If you prefer to create your tracking URL, use the information below as a guide. For example:

```javascript
https://myofferdomain.com?token_1=[[DeviceId]]&click_time=[[Timestamp]]*
```

The following DT macros are available for use in tracking URLs, allowing you to insert specific data points into your campaigns dynamically:
