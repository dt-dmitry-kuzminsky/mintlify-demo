---

Micro Bidding allows you to set different bids for countries and apps to maximize the performance of your campaign. It enables real-time bid adjustments throughout the campaign lifecycle based on the performance and quality of each traffic source.

#### Important

DT recommends enabling Micro Bidding to optimize campaign performance by adjusting bids based on the performance and quality of each traffic source.

## Configuring Micro Bidding

To enable micro bidding for your campaigns:

1. From the [ACP Edge](https://acp-edge.fyber.com/) dashboard, click **Micro Bidding** next to the relevant campaign.\
   The **Country Group** window appears.

#### Note

If your budget is unlimited at the campaign level, you can cap the budget at the **Country Group** level.

6. (Optional) To view all available apps within the **Country Group**, click **View All**.
7. (Optional) To adjust bids for individual apps within each **Country Group**, select an app and enter the **Bid** value.\
   The customized app bid appears in purple.

#### Note

* For countries not included in a **Country Group**, your campaign defaults to the bid set at the campaign level.
* If you disable or remove a **Country Group**, the countries in that group remain targeted, and your campaign defaults to the bid set at the campaign level.

## Metrics Per App

The Metric Picker allows you to analyze app performance. You can sort apps by any available metric, and the sorting applies to all active apps, not just those displayed by default. To evaluate performance within a specific time frame, select the desired period using the date picker.

Use the search bar to locate one or multiple apps. Enter app IDs separated by spaces or commas, or paste a list of IDs directly into the search bar.
