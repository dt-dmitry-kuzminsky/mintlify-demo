## Calling the API

#### Important

You must call this API before you initialize the SDK.

When you call this API, the [FairBid SDK](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/sections/9947507543196-SDKs) triggers the respective APIs on the mediated networks that support it:

* Privacy related APIs
* APIs for not tracking the ad ID (in compliance with Google Family program policies)

The [Networks and Related Regulatory Compliance](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013311257-Mediation-Regulatory-Compliance) table outlines network compliance levels. This information helps to determine which networks are suitable for the app. It outlines any additional steps required to ensure compliance with applicable laws, mediated network policies, and Play Store policies.

For detailed guidance on calling the API, see[Setting User as Child](/hc/en-us/articles/16847944034204).
