title: "Auto Update App"
---

**Auto Update** is a feature that updates an app on a device. Device users must opt in for auto updates, and your app must capture and send user opt-in status to DT. By default, automatic app updates by the Android OS requires an idle device state. App Updates through DT Ignite Services require the same idle device state:

* Device connected to an unmetered connection (NETWORK\_TYPE\_UNMETERED)
* Device is charging
* Device not actively in use

To implement **AutoUpdate** functionality, ensure that your app performs the following tasks:

* [Check if device user has opted in for Auto Update](#h_01GZEQ04DCN3HR53Y6FM30KQEF), and, if not already opted in, surface a UI to allow automatic app updates.
* [Send Auto Update options](#h_01GZEQ0NBA7150F1T7781PHBGX).
* [Listen to broadcast for auto update job scheduling and app installation results](#h_01GZEQ1EGS02V9AQSC430NZM1C).
* To test your Auto Update implementation, [set the device to the required idle state](#h_01GZEQPK6SGXN8R0B71QCPXFKK).

## Check for Auto Update Opt-In

The `getIsAutoUpdateEnabled` method is an asynchronous method that allows you to determine if a user has already opted in for Auto Update. For this method, DT returns the following values:

* true

  User has opted in for Auto Updates.

* false

  User has declined Auto Updates.

* null

  Opt in has never been set.

For **false** and **null** scenarios, the Host App is responsible for surfacing a UI to encourage the device user to opt in for auto updates.

## Send Auto Update Options

To automatically update apps, the device user must first opt in for this function. The Host App must collect the opt-in selection and send the opt-in to DT using the `setAutoUpdateEnabled` method (asynchronous).

```csharp
binding.checkboxUserOptIn.setOnCheckedChangeListener { _, isAutoUpdateEnabled -
    val bundle = Bundle()
    if (!"null".equals(binding.hostAppPartnerName.text.toString(), true)) {
        bundle.putString(SdkConstants.HOST_APP_PAYMENT_PARTNER_NAME, binding.hostAppPartnerName.text.toString())
    }
    if (!"null".equals(binding.hostAppOperatorToken.text.toString(), true)) {
        bundle.putString(SdkConstants.HOST_APP_OPERATOR_TOKEN_NAME, binding.hostAppOperatorToken.text.toString())
    }

    IgniteServiceSdk.setAutoUpdateEnabled(
        isAutoUpdateEnabled,
        binding.checkInstallSource.isChecked,
        binding.clientMMPUrlEditText.text.toString(),
        bundle
    )
}
```

## Parameters

* isAutoUpdateEnabled

  boolean flag that represents the users Auto Update opt-in status. Use one of the following values as there is no default value:

  * If user is opted in, use **true**.
  * If user is not opted in, or opt-in status uknown, use **false**.

* isCheckInstallSourceEnabled

  boolean flag that determines whether to check for the installation source of the app.

  #### Important

  If the previous installation source of the app is Google Play, auto update does **not** continue via the Ignite Services SDK.

  You must include one of the following values as there is no default value:

  * To check the previous installation source of the app, use **true**.
  * To procede without checking the installation source of the app, use **false**.

* mmpUrl

  string for the MMP tracking URL you want to fire when the app is updated

* metadata

  bundled data for further processing presented as a key-value pair. Use this to specify a variant for a payment partner app or a specific variant for a specific operator.\
  **Examples**

  * To install a specific apk version for *MyTelCo* customers, use the following string:

    `bundle.putString(SdkConstants.HOST_APP_OPERATOR_TOKEN_NAME, "MyTelCo")`

  * To install a specific variant of a *GameCoin*, use the following string:

    `bundle.putString(SdkConstants.HOST_APP_PAYMENT_PARTNER_NAME, "GameCoin")`

  #### Important

  You can send any key-value pair in the metadata bundle. However, before sending a key-value pair in the metadata bundle, you must inform DT which apk version you want to associate with this key-value pair.

## Broadcasts for App Updates

The SDK stores all App Update opt-in data and schedules update jobs for those opted-in.

## Broadcast - App Update Job Scheduling

Listen to the jobStatusBroadcastReceiver to track scheduled jobs.

```typescript
override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()

        val intentFilter = IntentFilter().apply {
            addAction(IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_JOB_SCHEDULED)
            addAction(IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_JOB_CANCELLED)
        }

        registerReceiver(jobStatusBroadcastReceiver, intentFilter)
    }
    
    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()

        unregisterReceiver(jobStatusBroadcastReceiver)
    }

    private val jobStatusBroadcastReceiver: BroadcastReceiver = object : BroadcastReceiver() {
        override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent) {
            when (intent.action) {
                IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_JOB_SCHEDULED -> {
                    toast("App Update Job Scheduled.")
                }
                IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_JOB_CANCELLED -> {
                    toast("App Update Job Cancelled.")
                }
                else -> {
                    println("$TAG Unknown Broadcast Action")
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

This broadcast receiver may contain the following actions:

* ACTION\_APP\_UPDATE\_JOB\_SCHEDULED

  Sent when App Update is successfully scheduled.

* ACTION\_APP\_UPDATE\_JOB\_CANCELLED

  Sent when App Update is successfully cancelled.

#### **Note**

DT does not broadcast when the App Update job fails to schedule. Instead, the next time the host app initializes the SDK, DT attempts to schedule the update again.

## Listen to Broadcast - App Update Job Completion

Listen to the BroadcastReceiver for installation success or failure of App Update jobs.

#### **Note**

Because activities may be killed before receiving a callback, do not define your receiver as an activity in your host app. Instead, define your receiver as an a*pplication class*to ensure receipt of App Update status.

```csharp
registerReceiver(
            object : BroadcastReceiver() {
                override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {
                    intent?.let {
                        when (it.action) {
                            IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_SUCCESS -> Log.d(
                                TAG,
                                "Demo App Updated Successful"
                            )
                            IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_FAILED -> Log.d(
                                TAG,
                                "Demo App Updated Failed"
                            )
                            else -> Log.d(TAG, "Invalid Action")
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            IntentFilter().apply {
                addAction(IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_SUCCESS)
                addAction(IgniteServiceSdk.ACTION_APP_UPDATE_FAILED)
            }
        )
```

This broadcast receiver may contain the following actions:

* ACTION\_APP\_UPDATE\_SUCCESS

  Sent when app has been successfully updated

* ACTION\_APP\_UPDATE\_FAILED

  Sent when app failed to update

## 

## Testing: Setting Device Idle State

When testing your Auto Update implementation, the test device state must be in an idle state:

* The device is connected to an unmetered connection (NETWORK\_TYPE\_UNMETERED)
* The device is charging
* The device is not actively in use

Use the following commands to set a device to the required idle state:

```php
$adb shell dumpsys deviceidle enabled deep								
#C1 (If output is 0 then run C2 command else run C3)

$adb shell dumpsys deviceidle enable deep								
#C2 (Run above command and check it should not be 0 now)

adb shell dumpsys deviceidle tempwhitelist -d 3000000 com.your.packagename		
#C3 (This commands set demo app jobs to run in device idle mode)

adb shell dumpsys deviceidle tempwhitelist								
#C4 (It should show output like "UID=SOME_NUMBER: SOME_TIME - shell")

adb shell dumpsys activity idle-maintenance								
#C5 (Invoke maintenance mode when device is idle, this will start the App Update Job)
```
