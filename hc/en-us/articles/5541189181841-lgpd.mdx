The Brazilian General Data Protection Law, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais ([LGPD](https://lgpd-brazil.info/)) sets guidelines for collecting and processing personal information from individuals in Brazil. LGPD requires that you only process personal data for legitimate, specific, explicit and clearly communicated purposes as defined by the Brazilian Data Protection Authority (ANPD).

Digital Turbine applies internal processes to anonymize user data and retain the data's value while protecting user identity. In addition, Digital Turbine flags its demand partners and mediated ad networks when a user declines LGPD consent and does not wish to receive targeted ads in the app.

## LGPD SDK APIs

All SDKs include APIs to communicate user consent provided to DT and share their consent to DT's demand partners and mediated ad networks.
<Note>
#### Note

To comply with LGPD requirements, update the DT SDK in your app. DT also recommends notifying your users to update the app to maintain compliance.
