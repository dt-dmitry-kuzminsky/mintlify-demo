title: "Install App By URI"
---

To install an app, the client should be connected and authenticated. When app install is triggered from the client, the Ignite Services Client SDK executes the task to install the app. Before installing, Ignite performs authorization check (**isAuthorized?** method in the following diagram). For more information about authentications, see [Authentication Guide](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/8368057468445-Authentication-Guide).

Application install by URI includes the following major activities:

* Verify the file integrity
* Copy file and install the app

The following diagram shows the sequence of calls and actions to install an application by URI via the Ignite Services Client SDK.

```php
fun install(
   data: String, 
   callback: IResponseCallback<InstallationResponse, Error, InstallationProgress>? = null, 
   metadata: Bundle = Bundle(), 
   action: Bundle = Bundle(), 
   config: RequestConfig = RequestConfig()
 )
```

## Type

Asynchronous

## Description

Initiates an install process on the specified URI. Responses will be returned in the **onSuccess()** callback function of **IResponseCallback**. The `onError()` callback function will return error responses. Status and progress information can be tracked in `onScheduled()`, `onProgress()`, and `onStart()` callbacks and will also be broadcasted to the Android BroadcastReceiver identified by the receiver parameter. Specify config options if needed (see API Spec - Retry Policy)

## Parameters

* action

  contains information for a custom broadcast to be triggered on task completion. Specify fully qualified class name of Android BroadcastReceiver to receive status and progress updates as receiver (e.g. com.myapp.receivers.MyBroadcastReceiver.kt)

* callback

  reference to an IResponseCallback instance to receive response or error config

* config

  request configuration options (see Retry Policy ) A String taskId is returned in onScheduled to be used to identify the task.

* data

  Uri of the application as String

* metadata

  metadata that client may attach to the calls for further processing

## Install Response Callback

```typescript
IgniteServiceSdk.instance().install(data, object:
                IResponseCallback<Response, Error> {
                override fun onSuccess(result: Response) {
                    //interact with generic response
                }

                override fun onError(error: Error) {
                    //interact with generic error
                }
            })
```
