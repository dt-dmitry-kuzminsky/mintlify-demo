title: "Cancel Task"
---

Sometimes you may not be interested in a task and wish to cancel it (per user request or your internal logic). SDK does not provide any feedback on the cancellation as this should be an impediment operation, and you should not worry if the task has been cancelled. It is guaranteed to be cancelled by Ignite.

```javascript
// Initialisation

// Specify task id received previously in broadcast or callbacks onScheduled() method

IgniteServiceSdk.instance().cancelTask(taskId)
// ...
```
