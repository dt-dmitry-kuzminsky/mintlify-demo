The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ([CCPA](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/)) protects the personal information of California residents. It applies to all businesses operating in California. If a California resident uses an app developer's mobile app, CCPA applies to the developer and all relevant partners that process users' personal information.
