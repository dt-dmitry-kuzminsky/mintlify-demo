Mediating DT Exchange SDK v8.3.5 requires AppLovin MAX SDK v13.0.0 or above.

If your current MAX Mediation SDK is below v13.0.0, and you can’t update it, please update your integration with any older version of MAX SDK using the code snippet below for the DT Exchange adapter, tested and provided by the MAX Mediation team.

```javascript
repositories {
  ⋮
  maven { url "https://artifacts.applovin.com/android/beta/" }
}

dependencies {
  ⋮
  implementation 'com.applovin.mediation:fyber-adapter:8.3.0.1-beta'
}
```
