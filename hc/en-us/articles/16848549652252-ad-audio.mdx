title: "Ad Audio"
---

If your app allows users to mute sound effects or music independently from the device volume controls, ensure a seamless audio experience by displaying ads that follow the same audio settings as your app. For example, if a user mutes sound effects or music in your app, display ads that are also muted.

Use the following API to mute the audio in ads:

Android iOS Unity

**Kotlin**

```javascript
FairBid.Settings.setMuted(true)
```

**Java**

```javascript
FairBid.Settings.setMuted(true);
```

If you wish to start the SDK with muted ads, make sure you call this API before starting the SDK:

**Kotlin**

```javascript
FairBid.Settings.setMuted(true)
FairBid.start(appId, activity)
```

**Java**

```javascript
FairBid.Settings.setMuted(true);
FairBid.start(appId, activity);
```

**Swift**

```javascript
//getter
let isMuted = FairBid.settings().isMuted
//setter
FairBid.settings().isMuted = true
```

**Objective-C**

```java
//getter
BOOL isMuted = FairBid.settings.isMuted;
//setter
FairBid.settings.muted = true;/code
```

**C#**

```javascript
using Fyber;


Settings.SetMuted(true);/code
```

#### Notes

* The ad audio mute setting does not affect ads from networks that are not listed above or programmatic ads rendered by DT FairBid.
* For ads from AdMob/GoogleBidding and DT Exchange, apply the mute setting **before** the ad is requested. If an ad is already loaded on the device before the user mutes the sound in the application (which applies the ad audio mute setting), the loaded ad still shows with audio.
