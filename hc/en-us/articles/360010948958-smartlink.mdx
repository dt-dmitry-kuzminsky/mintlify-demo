title: "Smartlink"

The Smartlink scheme allows advertisers and demand partners to direct users to an installed application. Smartlink redirects the user to a fallback URL when the app does not appear on the device. The scheme allows you to add click trackers to the primary and fallback URLs to track user interactions.

### Smartlink Example

```javascript
smartlink://navigate?
primaryUrl=fyberawesomeapp%3A%2F%2Flink&
primaryTrackingUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpx.fyber.com%2FtrackPrimaryClicked&
fallbackUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fyber.com&
fallbackTrackingUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpx.fyber.com%2FtrackFallbackClicked
```

The following table describes the Smartlink query parameters and their functions:

| COMPONENT             | DESCRIPTION                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primaryUrl`          | Defines a deep link to the target application which might be installed on the device.        |
| `fallbackUrl`         | Redirects the user to a webpage when the desired application is not installed on the device. |
| `primaryTrackingUrl`  | Fires an HTTP GET request when the primary URL opens successfully.                           |
| `fallbackTrackingUrl` | Fires an HTTP GET request when the fallback URL opens successfully.                          |

#### Note

You must define the following parameters for a valid Smartlink implementation:

* Scheme: `smartlink`

* Host path: `navigate`

* Tracking URLs: Specify one or multiple tracking URLs. Smartlink triggers all applicable URLs when the corresponding event occurs.
