title: "Install App By Package Name"
---

To install the app the client should be connected and authenticated. When app install is triggered from the client, Ignite SDK executes the task to install the app. Before installing Ignite performs authorization check (**isAuthorized?** method on the following diagram). For more information about client authorization, see [Authentication Guide](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/8368057468445-Authentication-Guide).

Application install by package name includes the following major activities:

* Check if client is allowed specified package name
* Download and install the app by package name

The following diagram shows the sequence of calls and actions to install an application by URI via the Ignite Services Client SDK.

```php
fun install(
  data: String, 
  callback: IResponseCallback<InstallationResponse, Error, InstallationProgress>? = null, 
  metadata: Bundle = Bundle(), 
  action: Bundle = Bundle(), 
  config: RequestConfig = RequestConfig()
)
```

## Type

Asynchronous

## Description

Initiates a download and install process on the specified package name. Responses will be **`onSuccess()`** callback function of IResponseCallback. The **`onError()`** callback function will return error responses. Status and progress information can be tracked in **`onScheduled()`**, **`onProgress()`**, and **`onStart()`** callbacks and will also be broadcasted to the Android BroadcastReceiver identified by the receiver parameter. If needed, configure retry options. For more information about configuring retry options, see [Retry Policy](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/8344099668637-Retry-Policy).

## Parameters

* action

  contains information for a custom broadcast to be triggered on task completion. Specify fully qualified class name of Android BroadcastReceiver to receive status and progress updates as receiver (for example: com.myapp.receivers.MyBroadcastReceiver.kt)

* callback

  reference to an IResponseCallback instance to receive response or error config

* config

  request configuration options for retries. A String taskId is returned in onScheduled to be used to identify the task. For more information about configuring retry options, see [Retry Policy](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/8344099668637-Retry-Policy).

* data

  package name of the application as String

* metadata

  bundled data for further processing presented as a key-value pair. For example, to install a specific apk version for *MyTelCo*, send the following string: `bundle.putString(SdkConstants.HOST_APP_OPERATOR_TOKEN_NAME, "MyTelCo")`

  #### Important

  You can send any key-value pair in the metadata bundle. However, before sending a key-value pair in the metadata bundle, you must inform DT which apk version you want to associate with this key-value pair.

## Install Response Callback

```typescript
IgniteServiceSdk.instance().install(data, object:
                IResponseCallback<Response, Error> {
                override fun onSuccess(result: Response) {
                    //interact with generic response
                }

                override fun onError(error: Error) {
                    //interact with generic error
                }
            })
```
