title: "Calculating An App'S Unique Users"
---

DT uses the app start event to count the app's unique users. When looking at a daily aggregation, this represents that app's DAU (daily active users).

DT uses the app's unique users to reflect in our reporting system with the following metrics:

| Metric                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Publisher App Unique Users             | The publisher app's unique active users. This metric is accurate only when a publisher initializes our SDK on app start! When splitting by day, it shows the daily active users (DAU) |
| Publisher ARPDAU                       | Publisher's average revenue per daily active users.**This metric is accurate only when a publisher initializes our SDK on app start**!                                               |
| OFW Engagement Rate                    | DT Offer Wall's daily engaging users divided by the publisher app's daily active users.                                                                                               |
| Offer Impressions per App Unique Users | Offer impressions divided by app unique users                                                                                                                                         |
| OFW Impressions per App Unique Users   | OFW impressions divided by app unique users                                                                                                                                           |

## Clarifications

* DT displays the unique users who opened the app during a chosen period of time and don't count duplicates (e.g. if timeframe = month, we show MAU)
* If DT identifies the same user from different countries (due to proximity), at the country level it appears twice, on a worldwide level - we count it once
* DT bases the count on the user game if provided. If not, DT counts based on device ID

#### Warning

These metrics are accurate only if a publisher initializes our SDK on app start!
