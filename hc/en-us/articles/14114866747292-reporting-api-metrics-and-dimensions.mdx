**Metrics** define what type of data you want to include in your report. **Dimensions** allow you to filter the data set based on specific values. Names of metrics and dimensions are case-sensitive.

## Metrics

## Dimensions

You can specify filter data based on any of the following supported dimensions. The generated report only contains data defined by the filter value(s) you specify in your report request. For example, if you request the `Country` dimension and specify `US` and `CA`, the generated report includes the specified metrics related only to the United States and Canada.

The following table describes the supported dimensions and how to specify values for each dimension in your JSON report request:
