title: "AdMob/Google Bidding"
---

This article provides steps to integrate AdMob/Google bidding for mediation.

#### Note

Mediation of AdMob Bidding placements are transacted on the **Google bidding** network. For more information, see Google's [documentation on partner bidding](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/12374122?sjid=7406285673992422155-NC).

AdMob currently supports the following [ad types](/hc/en-us/articles/360010915358-Ad-Types-and-Placement-ID):

* Banner
* Interstitial
* Rewarded
* MREC

To integrate AdMob/Google bidding as a DT mediated network:

* [Step 1: Locate AdMob parameters](#Step1).

* [Step 2: Add AdMob as a DT mediated network](#Step2):

  * [Add AdMob as a Waterfall network](#Waterfall).\
    This allows for traditional waterfall mediation with AdMob. Ensure that your app and bidding placements have been added to the AdMob network.

  * Add AdMob/Google bidding as a Bidding network:

    * [Add Google bidding as a manually managed Bidding network](#BidderManual).\
      This allows DT to include Google bidding in bidding mediation. Ensure that your app and bidding placements have been added to the AdMob network.
    * [Add Google bidding as an automatically managed Bidding network](#BidderAuto).\
      This allows DT to include Google bidding in bidding mediation. DT adds your app and bidding placements to the AdMob network on your behalf.

* [Step 3: Add the AdMob/Google bidding SDK to your integration](#Step3).

* [Step 4: Test your integration](#Step4).

## Step1: Locate AdMob Parameters

Depending on the type of mediation intend use, adding AdMob as a mediated network requires specific parameters from the AdMob Dashboard. Before you can locate these parameters, use the following table to ensure that you have completed any app setup tasks in the AdMob Dashboard.

| AdMob Tasks                                                                                                                                        | Waterfall | Bidding |           |

Once you have completed the necessary tasks in the Mintegral Dashboard, use the following table to determine which Mintegral parameters you need to locate.

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   | Waterfall | Bidding |           |
