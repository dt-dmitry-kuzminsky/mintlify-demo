Attribution providers track user interactions, attribute conversions to their sources, detect fraud, and provide real-time performance data. They also simplify server-to-server postbacks and streamline integration with other systems.

## Configuring Attribution Partners

To integrate your attribution partner and optimize your campaign performance:

1. [Create a campaign](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010956637-Campaign-Setup#h_01GQYYSF00JSE96ADN3201PENQ) in the DT [ACP Edge](https://acp-edge.fyber.com/login) Console.
2. Select one of the following tracking providers from the **Tracking Provider** drop-down list on the **Tracking** tab:

* * [Adjust](https://help.adjust.com/en/partner-setup/digital-turbine)
  * [AppsFlyer](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208209366-How-to-Configure-a-Campaign-with-Fyber)
  * [Kochava](https://support.kochava.com/campaign-management/create-an-install-campaign/?scrollto=marker_3)
  * [Mobile App Tracking by Tune](https://support.tune.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008248741-Passing-Values-to-a-Partner-Conversion-URL)
  * [Singular](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/20797177013659-Digital-Turbine-Media-Attribution-Integration#2_Create_the_Singular_Tracking_Link)

3. Generate a**Click URL**using the provider's instructions. See [Supported Macros](https://developer.digitalturbine.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011062618-Supported-Macros) for more information.

#### Note

Replace the generic URL macro key with the correct key name.

4. Copy the**DT Edge App ID**to update the DT integration with your provider. Then, do the following:

* * Log in to your attribution provider's platform.
  * Paste the **DT App ID** into the designated field provided by your partner.\
    This step ensures proper conversion tracking for old and new App IDs.

#### Note

* Always use the secure HTTPS URL your tracking provider provides to ensure maximum campaign reach.
* Save your **DT App ID** for Server-to-Server postback. Keep this ID secure and confidential to protect your data.

## Offer Suppression

Running campaigns across multiple networks may result in users installing your app through a different network. DT uses a suppression feature to prevent duplicate app installs and ensure you are not billed twice for the same user. This feature makes offers unavailable to users who have previously installed the app.

Check your tracking provider's platform settings to confirm they have transmitted the installed data to DT. In most cases, this option is enabled by default. Once your tracking provider reports installs and sessions, DT automatically excludes those users from targeting.
